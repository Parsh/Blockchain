    "## How does blockchain works?\n",
    "Given a random piece of tech, the first question is not how does it work, but what does it do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, the question should be what it is that Blockchain do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blockchain together with other protocols acts as a trust machine or a trust mechanism (a decentralised mechanism for emergent consensus) in a trustless environment (typically in public domains).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT) provisioning provenance and lineage of assets, consensus, immutability and finality, thereby generating an overall trust in a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In this digital world many of the things that we attach value is pure information (books, movies, software) but if it’s possible to transfer something infinitely and for free (internet is the enabler) then how do we preserve value** This is where blockchain come into a revolutionary play by providing capabilities like Value preservation (no double spending), generating Trust and providing an immutable record (append only) which acts as single source of Truth for everyone across the n/w.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Brief History of Blockchain:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the concept of a blockchain was first fully actualized in Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin Whitepaper, the underlying component technologies draw from years of research across cryptography, computing, and economics. In this section we will uncover some of this history.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the idea of centralization. Centralization, or control by a single authority or entity, is a common and pervasive form of governance. Governance refers to principles of organization and power. **We must trust central authorities, like banks, governments, and other institutions to maintain order and structure within the space they operate. This trust is broken when the central authorities can not maintain that order and structure**. For example, if your credit card information is stolen from the database of a bank you transact with, the centralization of your information in this bank has been used against you. **Centralized technology and data allows for the monopolization of power, monetization of data and creates a security risk.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problems with centralization came to a head during the [global financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008) of 2007-2008. On October 31, 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto (an alias for a still unidentified individual or group of individuals) published the Bitcoin Whitepaper, titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This paper described a way of exchanging a currency, Bitcoin, that combines cryptography, computer science, and game theory in its design and implementation**. Satoshi’s creation enabled a participant to digitally transact directly with another participant without relying on a single, centralized intermediary, such as a bank, to validate the payments. When we say peer-to-peer, we are describing a transaction from one entity to another, directly. There is no intermediary the transaction has to pass through. For example, if you schedule a payment via a banking app on your phone to a friend of yours, the actual flow of money goes from an account controlled by your bank to an account controlled by your friend's bank. If your friend does not have a bank account, you could send the money from your bank to a third party, like a money transfer company, where your friend could pick up the payment. Even if you withdrew the money from the bank and mailed it to your friend, you would need to have an address to send it to and rely on the security of your postal service to get the money there safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin attracted attention for its ability to allow for peer-to-peer transactions without a centralized intermediary. Technologists were drawn to the blockchain, the underlying component technologies on which Bitcoin operates. To introduce you to the concept, a **blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions or activity between two participants permanently with verification. This verification comes in the form of reviewing cryptographic functions and timestamps. Transactions can be verified on multiple computers, which are referred to as nodes. This makes the blockchain decentralized and transparent**. Blockchain technology can be uncoupled from the Bitcoin protocol and can be used for many other kinds of cryptocurrencies. It can also be applied across industries to a variety of use cases, specifically record of ownership tracking and management (often referred to as provenance), creative rights management, patient records, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the surge of attention to the Bitcoin codebase and white paper, Vitalik Buterin, a contributor to the community, saw some limitations in the design of Bitcoin and began designing an open source protocol starting in late 2013, now known as Ethereum. Ethereum also operates on a blockchain, but Ethereum adds features that extend the features of Bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chain of Blocks:\n",
    "The history of blockchain doesn't go back very far. But it does go back to the early 1990s when a pair of physicists, Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta, were trying to solve a big problem, how to keep the past secure, and keep digital information safe and resistant to tampering? **In 1991, they published the first paper to outline the use of a chain of cryptographically secured blocks to preserve the integrity of past information and protect it**. They had no idea at the time that ideas presented could be used to be formed new currencies or build the ecosystems that we see flourishing today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of Work:\n",
    "**In 1993, in response to the proliferation of spam and other network abuses, the concept of proof-of-work was established**, that sought to provide countermeasures to those.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hash Cash: \n",
    "    Hashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit email spam and \n",

    "    bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as part of the mining algorithm.     \n",
    "    Hashcash was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back.\n",

    "### Sybil Attack and Sybil resilience\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Sybil attack is an attack where a single adversary is controlling multiple nodes on a network. It is unknown to the network that the nodes are controlled by the same adversarial entity**. For example, an adversary can spawn up multiple computers, virtual machines, and IP addresses. They can create multiple accounts with different usernames and e-mail addresses and pretend that they all exist in different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Sybil attacks is a difficult problem. In centralized systems they are typically avoided through heuristics that do not provide cryptographic assurance of Sybil resilience. For example, a centralized entity may try to avoid Sybil attacks by requiring that an individual IP cannot create more than a specific number of user accounts in a given time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sybil attacks are avoided in Bitcoin by requiring block generation ability to be proportional to computational power available through the proof-of-work mechanism. That way, an adversary is limited in how many blocks they can produce**. This provides strong cryptographic guarantees of Sybil resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "> The adversary has limited computing power. **If the adversary present themselves as one entity to the network, the adversarial computing power will all be concentrated on that one entity. If the adversary presents themselves as 100 entities to the network – a Sybil attack –, then each of the entities will have 1/100th of the total adversarial power. Because in bitcoin what matters is the computational power, not the number of entities by count, creating more identities does not help the adversary produce more blocks.** \n",

    "## What is Decentralization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralization is fundamentally about shifting power and authority in a community away from one central entity and making that power available to the members themselves, making community members self-sovereign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralization also has concrete tangible benefits for networked systems. \n",
    "- For one, systems are less likely to fail if they rely on separated redundant components. \n",
    "- They're harder to attack, and it's harder for malicious entities to exploit the system's users who may not all be gathered in one place. A blockchain with 100 nodes is highly resistant to attack because if, say, five nodes go down, the system can easily continue operating with the other 95 remaining nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, **centralization of power can result in companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google finding ways to monetize user data and habits** in ways that the users may not like and may not even know about. **Users of popular free online services may think of themselves as the customer and the service that they're using the product. But that's actually backward. It's the users themselves and their information that is the product being sold. It's their data that is valuable.** But if it's your data, why are other people profiting off of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another of the benefits of decentralization is that it can put that value back in the hands of the user.** This is a significant shift in thinking about how systems can operate, and its potential impact is difficult to overstay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forms of Decentralization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main forms of decentralization, or how authority is transferred. In a post on Medium.com, Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, detailed the following three forms of decentralization:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architectural (de)centralization**  — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How many of those computers can it tolerate breaking down at any single time?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Political (de)centralization**  — how many individuals or organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical (de)centralization** — do the interface and data structures that the system presents and maintains look more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm? One simple heuristic is: if you cut the system in half, including both providers and users, will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units?\n",
    "\n",
    " - Let's get specific with an example. The computer or tablet on which you are reading this was very likely made by a company with a CEO and a board of executives. This company is very likely structured to have business units that take care of various components of building, marketing, and selling the device you are using. The CEO and the board of executives provide direction to the different business units so they can work together to build computers. If the company were to split up, the CEO and board of executives would have to decide (or be incentivized) to split the company up. The individual parts of the company could not decide to do that on their own. If the part of the company that assembles the keyboards decided they no longer wanted to be part of the larger company, they really do not have the choice to break off into another company. According to Vitalik, **this means the company is logically centralized**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another example that Vitalik uses is language. The speakers of any language follow grammatical rules and best practices despite the fact that there is no centralized authority forcing people to speak a certain way. Organizations that publish dictionaries do not have direct control over the language. People who speak the language are the ones with control over it. This is why languages evolve over time, with structure and character depending on the place and time in which it is expressed. An example is how Latin evolved over time into the modern day romance languages of Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Catalan. No central authority decided that Latin should evolve into these languages. In this case, **language is something that is logically decentralized.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the case of blockchains, they are politically decentralized because no one person has singular control over them. They are also architecturally decentralized because their infrastructure has no central point of failure, as each node keeps a copy of the blockchain. But, blockchains are logically centralized because the system behaves like one computer despite being spread apart on all the participating nodes in the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralization (politically and architecturally) allows blockchains to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Less likely to fail because they rely on many separate components.\n",
    "- Harder to attack because the networks are spread across many computers.\n",
    "- Harder for users with malicious intent to take advantage of users who are using the platform for its intended purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one node stops working, or even 100 nodes, the blockchain survives assuming there is at least one node up and running. This makes the blockchain very resistant to attacks. The blockchain does not stop working even if the power is lost in an entire country. This makes the blockchain very resilient, which cannot be said of many of the existing systems we use on the Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Currently, companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google dominate the Internet. They offer many free or cheap services because they are able to collect valuable data on their users, and find ways to monetize that data.** As a user of the modern internet, one is never too sure where their demographic and personal data is being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Through the implementation of decentralization, also called Web 3, data does not have to be stored in centralized systems. Data can be verified independently and individuals can transact directly with each other, instead of requiring a centralized entity to verify these interactions**. Micropayments become a feasible method of being rewarded for value created. **Users control how their data is used and accessed over the Internet, and can be paid for the use of their data. Decentralization dis-intermediates central control of systems**. Instead of a single company being responsible for writing information to a centralized database, the responsibility of recording transactions falls to anyone who wants to participate in a blockchain. This is a significant shift in thinking, but important in understanding how blockchains could be revolutionary—they are different both philosophically and technically—and are specifically engineered to be an alternative to the centralized systems we are familiar with.\n",

    "### The World Computer - Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralized products and solutions built on Ethereum have already hit market. Companies are finding ways to prevent identity theft, improve crowdfunding, pay musicians more fairly for their work, track food from farms to grocery stores, and many other use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Ethereum use cases are plenty, this technology promises something larger than just a few thousand applications. **The blockchain, specifically the Ethereum blockchain provides a set of instructions for creating digital representation of everything from physical objects to ideas. This is called Tokenization**. Tokenization allows for the distribution of tokens—representations of value or the permission to do some actions within an application. For example, a token could represent an opportunity to play a video game or download a song. Tokenizing an application is done on top of the Ethereum blockchain, giving creators of DApps new ways to do business on an open source system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, **creators of these blockchain-based applications can fund the building of their projects through selling tokens. Selling a token creates a new mechanism for fundraising. Another interesting property that can be given to tokens is to allow token holders to interact with the applications themselves via a token.** Think of a token as a key that grants access to a user to participate in the system in a specific way. For example, a token might represent access to read a certain number of written articles on a news website. The founders of the network keep a percentage of the tokens for themselves and if the network gains popularity, demand for the tokens rise while supply remains constant, making the price of the tokens increase. Founders can now monetize the networks they build by tokenizing their system and increasing the value of the system to the users. We are actually already familiar with a token. Ether (ETH) is the token for Ethereum. Ether allows a user to pay for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This is the special feature that Ether gives the holders.\n",

    "## Consensus - A Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Read: [Blockchain Consensus Protocols](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-consensus/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consensus, as a concept, is fundamental to any system where more than one entity is participating. As the Ethereum blockchain aims to include any participant that runs a node, there is a need to quickly reach agreement on whether to accept a new block as part of the chain when it is mined. Without the ability to reach this agreement, the blockchain can not create new blocks. A consensus mechanism is a set of rules that allows multiple machines that are connected together to work together while tolerating some machines providing incorrect data or failing completely. These properties are called fault-tolerance and resilience. A blockchain needs a consensus mechanism to ensure there are a set of rules for creating and accepting each newly created block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, **the purpose of a consensus mechanism in a blockchain is to allow a group of separate nodes to distribute the right to update the system according to a specific set of rules amongst a set of participants and in a secure way**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of Work\n",
    "When you think about proof of work, think of it as rewarding a minor for their share of the computational power on the network. **If you own say 10% of the computational power on the network because of the random nature of hashing, you can expect 10% of the mining rewards to go to you**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawback**: It uses huge amounts of energy in a large network and as such can't support very large transaction volumes, and because of that power use, transaction fees can be high and they get higher as the network grows because those fees have to effectively pay for all that power use, plus profit for the miners. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of Stake\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of stake works a little differently. **Blocks are not mined, they're forged and instead of rewarding minors for the proportion of computing power they have, it rewards participants called forgers based on the proportion of the currency they own**. So, roughly speaking if you owned 10% of all the cryptocurrency, you could expect to forge 10% of the blocks on the network and hence take 10% of all the fees. \n",
    "\n",
    "**When creating a block, a forger stakes their currency in escrow. If the block turns out to include a fraudulent transaction, they lose that stake**. This incentivizes following the rules and correctly validating transactions on the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous benefits to this system:\n",
    "- One is that it would drive transaction costs way down because you wouldn't be paying for all the electricity going into mining. **You instead pay what is effectively an interest rate on the loan of a given stake**.\n",
    "- This system since it doesn't rely on mining would be faster and more efficient. \n",
    "- There is also a **protection against attack because anyone attacking the network would also have to hold a great deal of capital in the network, which would make such an attack self-defeating**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "One problem with proof of stake is that **individuals with small balances will likely never get the opportunity to create a block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Stake - Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leased Proof of Stake:**<br>\n",
    "Leased proof of stake addresses this by allowing small balance holders to stake a node. The node gains access to all the funds staked to it for the purposes of determining its odds of forging a block. But control of the funds remains entirely in the hands of the staking individual, that individual then takes a proportionate share of the fees generated if their least node forges a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delegated Proof of Stake:**<br>\n",
    "Read: [What is Delegated Proof of Stake?](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-delegated-proof-of-stake-897a2f0558f9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegated proof of stake works differently. In this case, **the number of currency tokens you own represent the number of votes you have to nominate a witness, who among other witnesses is trusted to process and validate transactions in amounts relative to the number of votes they have**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a witness turns out to act fraudulently, they can quickly be voted out and replaced by other witnesses. **The top witnesses get paid the most so there is competition to be a good honest witness.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The delegated proof of stake model also has a group called the **delegates, who are trusted parties that manage the operation of a network** but don't take part in transaction validation and block production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of Importance:**<br>\n",
    "This one is much like proof of stake in that those with a greater share of currency have a greater probability to forge blocks. However, some more variables are thrown in the mix, which give each node a combined score and that score is used to determine their share of forging probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The variables used could be anything judged to be healthy for the network. Maybe you want to favor nodes that have more recent transaction activity or perhaps you'd like to punish currency hoarding by decreasing the reward a forger gets if they possess two concentrated a share of the network's wealth.** These are all options under proof of importance."

    "Where **public blockchains allow anyone to download the software and create a node, consortium blockchains only allow certain members to be nodes. That is, nodes are granted permission to join, which is why another name for consortium blockchain is shared permission**. <br>\n",
    "For example, you might have a consortium blockchain in which three companies and the government regulator operate nodes. You could set up your blockchain so that all four entities have to sign transactions and all would be able to access and audit this ledger without needing access to the internal ledgers of the constituent organizations. **This could be considered a low trust environment. Organizations have some trust in each other but not complete trust**. Power isn't centralized with any one company but the public can't see the transactions. \n",

    "**Are private blockchains just databases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, **private blockchains are essentially databases on steroids (DLTs)**.

Private blockchains are of particular use to developers who can set up and control their own blockchain instance to test their software and experiment with prototypes. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Due to the transparency of a blockchain and the need to involve a community of computers in order to bring the blockchain to consensus, companies and governments have introduced the idea of private blockchains**. This section will explore the differences between public and private blockchains and what types of problems each are suited to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between public vs. private blockchains boil down to the participants of the network. \n",

When specific nodes are given the authority for the creation of new blocks, this is consensus mechanism is called proof of authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that enterprises are adopting the idea of private blockchains more quickly than they are public blockchains. **Private blockchains alleviate concerns that businesses have around making their data transparent and reliant on a community of incentivized individuals to create new blocks in the chain.** In order for a blockchain to be able to handle the requirements of their business, they are more comfortable with a private blockchain where the business controls the nodes submitting transactions and creating new blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to read more on public and private blockchains, we recommend reading [Public and Private Blockchains: Enemies or Allies? Why the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance will prove the latter](https://medium.com/@rtylersmith/public-and-private-blockchains-enemies-or-allies-45f050c38fc0) by R. Tyler Smith, and we found the following quote quite relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"One thing that blockchains do extremely well is allow entities who do not trust one another to collaborate in a meaningful way. This is one reason people see so much potential in this immature technology\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So it stands to reason that eventually we will begin to see large scale deployments of the technology attempting to do exactly that, connect groups such as businesses, governments, churches, and the like. Public blockchains can already make this claim, however they currently fall short of particular requirements such as privacy and scalability. **Private blockchains can provide solutions for these short falls and enable greater privacy and transaction throughput because all the nodes are strictly controlled. However, there is a trade-off, they do so at the cost of their ability to connect any and all to the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**While it may seem like private blockchains are the better choice between the two, public blockchains have many benefits. Because of the large volume of participants on the public blockchain, participants are often protected from engaging in activities on the blockchain that they have no authority to do**. Public blockchains are also open and benefit from gaining a variety of participants. We believe that adding more participants adds more value to the public blockchain, as each participant increases opportunities for peer-to-peer interactions and innovations to arise. Bitcoin and Ethereum both have a public blockchain (referred to as Bitcoin mainnet and Ethereum mainnet) that anyone can participate in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With a consortium blockchain, the consensus mechanisms of this blockchain are controlled by a limited set of nodes.** The right to access the blockchain can either be restricted to the predetermined set of nodes or to the public (or to a mix of these rights). **Considering these possibilities, consortium blockchains can be thought of as partially decentralized.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> While public blockchains are typically advertised as completely decentralized, private blockchains have more tightly controlled permissions while still maintaining the decentralization principles that classic blockchains provide users with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given the nature of a private blockchain, attacks would come from validators that are known to the network, since only validators with permission to participate are able to. Therefore, there is a reduced reliance on crypto economics to create incentives and disincentives for validators, as they were specifically granted access to the network (hence private blockchains do not require cryptocurrencies to incentivise validators)**. Private blockchains also have the capability to blacklist certain users. Additionally, the predetermined controllers of the network can very easily make changes to the blockchain if needed.**Due to the smaller number of contributors to the network, transactions are often not as energy intensive, process faster, and faults within the network are more easily rectified. The tradeoff is the lack of transparency and decentralization.**\n",

Throughout the notebook so far, we've discussed each different blockchain as an ecosystem unto itself separated from all the others. **There are, however, efforts to interweave blockchains with one another to provide services that work more transparently from one to the other.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You could, for example, have an application on the Ethereum blockchain that works with Bitcoins and does so transparently for a user. **The only thing to bear in mind here is that blockchains need not be Islands disconnected from one another, there are many projects underway that tie different blockchains together in novel and powerful ways.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Internet Analogy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analogy to the Internet is also a good one because the Internet itself is not one network, but it's a collection of different networks. So, **when we talk about blockchain interoperability, the value of different blockchains being able to share information increases the value of each of them exponentially**. In the same way as in 1994, we couldn't really imagine the way that the World Wide Web would evolve to what we have today, the social networks, and e-commerce, and pervasive video. **If you look at the way the different blockchains could interact, the possibilities are literally endless**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Another point that's interesting to note is that Ethereum is the only blockchain that has a public version and a private version that are compatible. So, there are a number of companies who have private versions of Ethereum with a roadmap to move toward the public blockchain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interoperability - A high level view\n",
    "\n",
    "The blockchain ecosystem is exploding. Implementing different blockchain protocols offers particular benefits for users of the system, so various blockchains are created to suit their creators goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variety in design creates a healthy, scalable, and resilient ecosystem, but creates its own problems. **Disparate blockchains are isolated environments and transferring value between them is difficult. We currently rely on centralized exchanges which can be slow and expensive. Creating programmatic connections between blockchains to ease transfer of value is an important factor for mass adoption of these systems**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we explore several approaches in connecting blockchains, such as pegs and relay blockchains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Two Way Peg\n",
    "\n",
    "**A two way peg allows users of a blockchain to deposit the native cryptocurrency of a blockchain and receive the cryptocurrency of another blockchain on the other network**. A classic example of this system is **BTC Relay, which acts as a peg between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)**. Holders of bitcoin can send BTC to a Bitcoin address, thereby releasing a certain amount of ETH on their behalf on the Ethereum blockchain. This enables Bitcoin holders to access functionality built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Internet of Blockchains\n",
    "\n",
    "**The two way peg is a step in the right direction in terms of enabling cross chain functionality, but the goal is to achieve greater interoperability, analogous to the internet in the sense that it is a network of networks**. The current blockchain landscape is similar to the web in 1994 - we couldn’t imagine social networks, e-commerce or pervasive video conferencing and look where we are almost 25 years later. **Designing systems that can scale as effectively as the internet is important for the future of the blockchain technology.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Paul Kohlhass writes in his Introduction to Polkadot and Parachains:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"A future of multiple blockchain networks is increasingly likely. A Web 3.0 architecture of buzzing public blockchains, private consortium ledgers, anonymous zero knowledge proof chains and all the countless applications running on top of each of them. **Not one chain to rule them all, but a world of diversity where individual chains serve specific use cases and specifications.**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each blockchain has advantages and disadvantages. **An internet of blockchains would allow us to transfer value between blockchains to take advantage of specific features relevant to specific applications, regardless of which network holds each stakeholders assets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If Bitcoin truly emerges at “the gold of the internet” the network will continue to hold massive amounts of value, but with potentially high transactions fees and longer block times it may not be ideal for applications requiring microtransactions. Another blockchain might be better suited for this application. Additionally, the programmability of Ethereum makes it valuable for applications requiring smart contracts, but if we want additional privacy we might want to conduct transactions on a different network that enables greater privacy, like Zcash. If each blockchain has huge utility, they can do even more when connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several projects that aim to tackle this enormous challenge. **Polkadot** facilitates authenticated transaction between blockchains using a central relay chain with parachains and bridges to external blockchains. The project **Cosmos** is a team working on hub (called the Cosmos Hub) connected to other blockchains via an inter-blockchain communication protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inter-chain operability is an important area of research in the blockchain space and could help lead to improvements regarding scalability, consensus and privacy.\n",

    "## Interoperability Specific Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Corresponding Read: [Blockchain Interoperability](https://blockonomi.com/blockchain-interoperability/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### BTC-Relay\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012, a developer named Joseph Chow created BTC-Relay, and a few years later he joined ConsenSys. The purpose of BTC-Relay is to take information from the Bitcoin blockchain, and use it in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. So for example, say that I wanted to be able to pay someone in Ether based on having received a payment on the Bitcoin blockchain. I would be able to create a smart contract that takes in information about a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, and then executes the ether transfer once I have that confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order for my smart contract to work, I'm going to need some information in the form of a proof from the Bitcoin blockchain. So, the way that we're going to get this proof is in the form of a Merkle proof as we talked about in earlier segments, which comes from the header on a Bitcoin blockchain. So, instead of taking the header and the body, we can look at just the headers for our proof. So, the way that we get that into a smart contract and be able to use it, is through something called a Simplified Payment Verification or SPV. So, what we do here and what BTC-Relay does is have a copy, in effect a light copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin transactions that you can check. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, when the smart contract needs to know whether I've been paid at this Bitcoin address, instead of having to look at the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the SPV can determine that that specific transaction has gone through. The beauty of this design is that you can separate the different elements, and that increases security. So, BTC-Relay having the SPV and being able to verify means that BTC-Relay doesn't need to know what address my smart contract is sending to. It just needs to be able to verify that the Bitcoin transaction happened. For BTC-Relay to get the information from the SPV, it needs to be provided. The way this works is similar to other blockchains where there's an incentive for our participants for nodes on the system to provide that data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interledger Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Another one is called the Interledger protocol. This is something that two employees at Ripple developed in 2015. Ripple is a company and a cryptocurrency that facilitates bank to bank transfers between different countries. So the way that the Interledger protocol works is by having various connectors, and validation stages as a transaction moves between various different blockchains. They've done a demo of this across seven different blockchains. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Polkadot\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to blockchain interoperability is Polkadot. So, Polkadot is planning to use three different components having a relay chain, parent chains which participate in the system, and then different bridges to connect to blockchains like Ethereum. So, Polkadot is planning on launching their genesis block in 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosmos\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is Cosmos which is planning to launch in early 2018, and it's modeled on a concept called side chains, a different approach to working with the Bitcoin blockchain. The concept is to have a hub which the first one will be the cosmos hub, and then a variety of zones around it that connect. Then eventually, they plan to have many different hubs, and different zones can be a hub for different components. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Consortias\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also various consortia that are working on different approaches to blockchain interoperability. One of them is the **Enterprise Ethereum Alliance**, and one of their goals is to work with various industries and working groups to develop interoperability standards. Another one is the **Blockchain Interoperability Alliance**, which is a group of several companies and taking their specific approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interoperability Supportive Technologies**<br>\n",
    "It's also worth noting that there are supportive technologies that employ blockchain interoperability. So, there are a number of different files storage approaches. So for example, the IPFS, the Interplanetary File System, and Swarm where instead of files being saved in central server, they're saved in a distributed fashion. "

    "For all the hype around blockchain technology, it can't do everything and it shouldn't. But for the things it does well, it's unprecedented. Twenty-five years ago, the idea that you could have a functioning cash system operating on a peer-to-peer network without any central authority or government backing, and created entirely electronically and without real-world assets would seem the stuff of futurist fiction.

    "## Cryptocurrencies vs Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "### Currency\n",
    "\n",
    "A currency is something exchangeable that holds value intrinsically. Not all block chains have an associated currency. Bitcoin and Ethereum do and prospectively they're called Bitcoin and Ether. Because of their intrinsic value, these are sometimes called intrinsic tokens. A coin is a unit of cryptocurrency associated with a given blockchain network. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **The vaule of a currency comes from it's scarcity as well as the collective agreement about its worth. It's we, humans, who put our trust in something and that is what make that thing valuable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decentralized cryptocurrencies were born when technology enabled electronic currency to have the same properties as physical currency**. \n",
    "- The difficulty of mining made it rare. \n",
    "- The network properties and consensus mechanisms made it reliable, and\n",
    "- public-key cryptography and signing allowed for ownership transfer and tradeability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Token\n",
    "\n",
    "A token is usually more like a share in a company, it's tradable, sellable, you own it, but it can also be seen as a proof of an ownership stake in something and that thing is what has value. So, **the value of the token is extrinsic to it and that is in contrast to the value intrinsic to a coin**. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a blockchain tokens are covered in the same way as coins, but it's an important distinction to make. For example, on the Ethereum blockchain, you might buy tokens with your Ether, but you wouldn't buy Ether with your tokens, you would sell your tokens for Ether. **Tokens can be created arbitrarily on the Ethereum network. If you have a project, you could invent a token and sell it to fund raise. The value of your token is associated to whatever is behind it, whatever it represents.** \n",
    "\n",
    "### ICO and Fundraising\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular uses for tokens is to hold an ICO or initial coin offerings. Again, coins and tokens are often used interchangeably. **An ICO is like a crypto version of an IPO or initial public offering. In an IPO, accompany offers ownership shares to the public in order to raise money. The ICO is the same, it's a way for projects to get funded in exchange for shares of ownership**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IPOs are currently very well regulated, whereas ICOs are much more in a wild west stage**. There is a lot of promise here, but there is also some risk. ICOs are pretty new. The ICO is also a process by which new cryptocurrencies can be introduced to the public. Instead of selling an ownership stake in something else, it's an offer to buy a new currency, with the hope that the associated blockchain will grow in popularity, making that currency more valuable. This would be most similar to buying foreign currency and hoping that the issuing country's economy strengthens. An investor would in either ICO case, hope that the value increases over time, so that they could sell their shares or coins for profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you, the reader, were tasked with starting a company, the likely methods you would choose in order to initially fund it would likely be putting in your own money, asking those within your network of family, friends, and connections for money, going to an institution that could lend you the money (like a bank or a venture capital investor), or turning to a platform like Kickstarter to raise money from the crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine that you could tap into all of those funding sources at the same time. It would be a very powerful way to raise funds for the company you are trying to build. Issuing a token on your platform allows you to start your company using investment from individuals or entities that decide to contribute to your venture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coinbase, Coin Center, Union Square Ventures and ConsenSys created the following framework as a starting point for developers and companies entering the space and launching a token. It can be used to analyze the likelihood that a particular blockchain token (e.g. any given App Coin) would be subject to US federal securities law**. It also establishes a set of best practices for token crowdsales. This is not legal advice, rather a framework for thinking about legal implications of tokens.\n",
