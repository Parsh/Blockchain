    "## How does blockchain works?\n",
    "Given a random piece of tech, the first question is not how does it work, but what does it do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, the question should be what it is that Blockchain do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blockchain together with other protocols acts as a trust machine or a trust mechanism (a decentralised mechanism for emergent consensus) in a trustless environment (typically in public domains).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT) provisioning provenance and lineage of assets, consensus, immutability and finality, thereby generating an overall trust in a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In this digital world many of the things that we attach value is pure information (books, movies, software) but if it’s possible to transfer something infinitely and for free (internet is the enabler) then how do we preserve value** This is where blockchain come into a revolutionary play by providing capabilities like Value preservation (no double spending), generating Trust and providing an immutable record (append only) which acts as single source of Truth for everyone across the n/w.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Brief History of Blockchain:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the concept of a blockchain was first fully actualized in Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin Whitepaper, the underlying component technologies draw from years of research across cryptography, computing, and economics. In this section we will uncover some of this history.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the idea of centralization. Centralization, or control by a single authority or entity, is a common and pervasive form of governance. Governance refers to principles of organization and power. **We must trust central authorities, like banks, governments, and other institutions to maintain order and structure within the space they operate. This trust is broken when the central authorities can not maintain that order and structure**. For example, if your credit card information is stolen from the database of a bank you transact with, the centralization of your information in this bank has been used against you. **Centralized technology and data allows for the monopolization of power, monetization of data and creates a security risk.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problems with centralization came to a head during the [global financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008) of 2007-2008. On October 31, 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto (an alias for a still unidentified individual or group of individuals) published the Bitcoin Whitepaper, titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This paper described a way of exchanging a currency, Bitcoin, that combines cryptography, computer science, and game theory in its design and implementation**. Satoshi’s creation enabled a participant to digitally transact directly with another participant without relying on a single, centralized intermediary, such as a bank, to validate the payments. When we say peer-to-peer, we are describing a transaction from one entity to another, directly. There is no intermediary the transaction has to pass through. For example, if you schedule a payment via a banking app on your phone to a friend of yours, the actual flow of money goes from an account controlled by your bank to an account controlled by your friend's bank. If your friend does not have a bank account, you could send the money from your bank to a third party, like a money transfer company, where your friend could pick up the payment. Even if you withdrew the money from the bank and mailed it to your friend, you would need to have an address to send it to and rely on the security of your postal service to get the money there safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin attracted attention for its ability to allow for peer-to-peer transactions without a centralized intermediary. Technologists were drawn to the blockchain, the underlying component technologies on which Bitcoin operates. To introduce you to the concept, a **blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions or activity between two participants permanently with verification. This verification comes in the form of reviewing cryptographic functions and timestamps. Transactions can be verified on multiple computers, which are referred to as nodes. This makes the blockchain decentralized and transparent**. Blockchain technology can be uncoupled from the Bitcoin protocol and can be used for many other kinds of cryptocurrencies. It can also be applied across industries to a variety of use cases, specifically record of ownership tracking and management (often referred to as provenance), creative rights management, patient records, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the surge of attention to the Bitcoin codebase and white paper, Vitalik Buterin, a contributor to the community, saw some limitations in the design of Bitcoin and began designing an open source protocol starting in late 2013, now known as Ethereum. Ethereum also operates on a blockchain, but Ethereum adds features that extend the features of Bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chain of Blocks:\n",
    "The history of blockchain doesn't go back very far. But it does go back to the early 1990s when a pair of physicists, Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta, were trying to solve a big problem, how to keep the past secure, and keep digital information safe and resistant to tampering? **In 1991, they published the first paper to outline the use of a chain of cryptographically secured blocks to preserve the integrity of past information and protect it**. They had no idea at the time that ideas presented could be used to be formed new currencies or build the ecosystems that we see flourishing today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of Work:\n",
    "**In 1993, in response to the proliferation of spam and other network abuses, the concept of proof-of-work was established**, that sought to provide countermeasures to those.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hash Cash: \n",
    "    Hashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit email spam and \n",
    "    denial-of-service attacks, and more recently has become known for its use in   \n",
    "    bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as part of the mining algorithm.     \n",
    "    Hashcash was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back.\n",

    "### Sybil Attack and Sybil resilience\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Sybil attack is an attack where a single adversary is controlling multiple nodes on a network. It is unknown to the network that the nodes are controlled by the same adversarial entity**. For example, an adversary can spawn up multiple computers, virtual machines, and IP addresses. They can create multiple accounts with different usernames and e-mail addresses and pretend that they all exist in different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Sybil attacks is a difficult problem. In centralized systems they are typically avoided through heuristics that do not provide cryptographic assurance of Sybil resilience. For example, a centralized entity may try to avoid Sybil attacks by requiring that an individual IP cannot create more than a specific number of user accounts in a given time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sybil attacks are avoided in Bitcoin by requiring block generation ability to be proportional to computational power available through the proof-of-work mechanism. That way, an adversary is limited in how many blocks they can produce**. This provides strong cryptographic guarantees of Sybil resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "> The adversary has limited computing power. **If the adversary present themselves as one entity to the network, the adversarial computing power will all be concentrated on that one entity. If the adversary presents themselves as 100 entities to the network – a Sybil attack –, then each of the entities will have 1/100th of the total adversarial power. Because in bitcoin what matters is the computational power, not the number of entities by count, creating more identities does not help the adversary produce more blocks.** \n",

    "## What is Decentralization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralization is fundamentally about shifting power and authority in a community away from one central entity and making that power available to the members themselves, making community members self-sovereign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralization also has concrete tangible benefits for networked systems. \n",
    "- For one, systems are less likely to fail if they rely on separated redundant components. \n",
    "- They're harder to attack, and it's harder for malicious entities to exploit the system's users who may not all be gathered in one place. A blockchain with 100 nodes is highly resistant to attack because if, say, five nodes go down, the system can easily continue operating with the other 95 remaining nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, **centralization of power can result in companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google finding ways to monetize user data and habits** in ways that the users may not like and may not even know about. **Users of popular free online services may think of themselves as the customer and the service that they're using the product. But that's actually backward. It's the users themselves and their information that is the product being sold. It's their data that is valuable.** But if it's your data, why are other people profiting off of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another of the benefits of decentralization is that it can put that value back in the hands of the user.** This is a significant shift in thinking about how systems can operate, and its potential impact is difficult to overstay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forms of Decentralization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main forms of decentralization, or how authority is transferred. In a post on Medium.com, Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, detailed the following three forms of decentralization:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architectural (de)centralization**  — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How many of those computers can it tolerate breaking down at any single time?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Political (de)centralization**  — how many individuals or organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical (de)centralization** — do the interface and data structures that the system presents and maintains look more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm? One simple heuristic is: if you cut the system in half, including both providers and users, will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units?\n",
    "\n",
    " - Let's get specific with an example. The computer or tablet on which you are reading this was very likely made by a company with a CEO and a board of executives. This company is very likely structured to have business units that take care of various components of building, marketing, and selling the device you are using. The CEO and the board of executives provide direction to the different business units so they can work together to build computers. If the company were to split up, the CEO and board of executives would have to decide (or be incentivized) to split the company up. The individual parts of the company could not decide to do that on their own. If the part of the company that assembles the keyboards decided they no longer wanted to be part of the larger company, they really do not have the choice to break off into another company. According to Vitalik, **this means the company is logically centralized**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another example that Vitalik uses is language. The speakers of any language follow grammatical rules and best practices despite the fact that there is no centralized authority forcing people to speak a certain way. Organizations that publish dictionaries do not have direct control over the language. People who speak the language are the ones with control over it. This is why languages evolve over time, with structure and character depending on the place and time in which it is expressed. An example is how Latin evolved over time into the modern day romance languages of Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Catalan. No central authority decided that Latin should evolve into these languages. In this case, **language is something that is logically decentralized.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the case of blockchains, they are politically decentralized because no one person has singular control over them. They are also architecturally decentralized because their infrastructure has no central point of failure, as each node keeps a copy of the blockchain. But, blockchains are logically centralized because the system behaves like one computer despite being spread apart on all the participating nodes in the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralization (politically and architecturally) allows blockchains to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Less likely to fail because they rely on many separate components.\n",
    "- Harder to attack because the networks are spread across many computers.\n",
    "- Harder for users with malicious intent to take advantage of users who are using the platform for its intended purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one node stops working, or even 100 nodes, the blockchain survives assuming there is at least one node up and running. This makes the blockchain very resistant to attacks. The blockchain does not stop working even if the power is lost in an entire country. This makes the blockchain very resilient, which cannot be said of many of the existing systems we use on the Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Currently, companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google dominate the Internet. They offer many free or cheap services because they are able to collect valuable data on their users, and find ways to monetize that data.** As a user of the modern internet, one is never too sure where their demographic and personal data is being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Through the implementation of decentralization, also called Web 3, data does not have to be stored in centralized systems. Data can be verified independently and individuals can transact directly with each other, instead of requiring a centralized entity to verify these interactions**. Micropayments become a feasible method of being rewarded for value created. **Users control how their data is used and accessed over the Internet, and can be paid for the use of their data. Decentralization dis-intermediates central control of systems**. Instead of a single company being responsible for writing information to a centralized database, the responsibility of recording transactions falls to anyone who wants to participate in a blockchain. This is a significant shift in thinking, but important in understanding how blockchains could be revolutionary—they are different both philosophically and technically—and are specifically engineered to be an alternative to the centralized systems we are familiar with.\n",

    "### The World Computer - Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralized products and solutions built on Ethereum have already hit market. Companies are finding ways to prevent identity theft, improve crowdfunding, pay musicians more fairly for their work, track food from farms to grocery stores, and many other use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Ethereum use cases are plenty, this technology promises something larger than just a few thousand applications. **The blockchain, specifically the Ethereum blockchain provides a set of instructions for creating digital representation of everything from physical objects to ideas. This is called Tokenization**. Tokenization allows for the distribution of tokens—representations of value or the permission to do some actions within an application. For example, a token could represent an opportunity to play a video game or download a song. Tokenizing an application is done on top of the Ethereum blockchain, giving creators of DApps new ways to do business on an open source system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, **creators of these blockchain-based applications can fund the building of their projects through selling tokens. Selling a token creates a new mechanism for fundraising. Another interesting property that can be given to tokens is to allow token holders to interact with the applications themselves via a token.** Think of a token as a key that grants access to a user to participate in the system in a specific way. For example, a token might represent access to read a certain number of written articles on a news website. The founders of the network keep a percentage of the tokens for themselves and if the network gains popularity, demand for the tokens rise while supply remains constant, making the price of the tokens increase. Founders can now monetize the networks they build by tokenizing their system and increasing the value of the system to the users. We are actually already familiar with a token. Ether (ETH) is the token for Ethereum. Ether allows a user to pay for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This is the special feature that Ether gives the holders.\n",

    "## Consensus - A Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Read: [Blockchain Consensus Protocols](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-consensus/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consensus, as a concept, is fundamental to any system where more than one entity is participating. As the Ethereum blockchain aims to include any participant that runs a node, there is a need to quickly reach agreement on whether to accept a new block as part of the chain when it is mined. Without the ability to reach this agreement, the blockchain can not create new blocks. A consensus mechanism is a set of rules that allows multiple machines that are connected together to work together while tolerating some machines providing incorrect data or failing completely. These properties are called fault-tolerance and resilience. A blockchain needs a consensus mechanism to ensure there are a set of rules for creating and accepting each newly created block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, **the purpose of a consensus mechanism in a blockchain is to allow a group of separate nodes to distribute the right to update the system according to a specific set of rules amongst a set of participants and in a secure way**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of Work\n",
    "When you think about proof of work, think of it as rewarding a minor for their share of the computational power on the network. **If you own say 10% of the computational power on the network because of the random nature of hashing, you can expect 10% of the mining rewards to go to you**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawback**: It uses huge amounts of energy in a large network and as such can't support very large transaction volumes, and because of that power use, transaction fees can be high and they get higher as the network grows because those fees have to effectively pay for all that power use, plus profit for the miners. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of Stake\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of stake works a little differently. **Blocks are not mined, they're forged and instead of rewarding minors for the proportion of computing power they have, it rewards participants called forgers based on the proportion of the currency they own**. So, roughly speaking if you owned 10% of all the cryptocurrency, you could expect to forge 10% of the blocks on the network and hence take 10% of all the fees. \n",
    "\n",
    "**When creating a block, a forger stakes their currency in escrow. If the block turns out to include a fraudulent transaction, they lose that stake**. This incentivizes following the rules and correctly validating transactions on the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous benefits to this system:\n",
    "- One is that it would drive transaction costs way down because you wouldn't be paying for all the electricity going into mining. **You instead pay what is effectively an interest rate on the loan of a given stake**.\n",
    "- This system since it doesn't rely on mining would be faster and more efficient. \n",
    "- There is also a **protection against attack because anyone attacking the network would also have to hold a great deal of capital in the network, which would make such an attack self-defeating**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "One problem with proof of stake is that **individuals with small balances will likely never get the opportunity to create a block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Stake - Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leased Proof of Stake:**<br>\n",
    "Leased proof of stake addresses this by allowing small balance holders to stake a node. The node gains access to all the funds staked to it for the purposes of determining its odds of forging a block. But control of the funds remains entirely in the hands of the staking individual, that individual then takes a proportionate share of the fees generated if their least node forges a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delegated Proof of Stake:**<br>\n",
    "Read: [What is Delegated Proof of Stake?](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-delegated-proof-of-stake-897a2f0558f9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegated proof of stake works differently. In this case, **the number of currency tokens you own represent the number of votes you have to nominate a witness, who among other witnesses is trusted to process and validate transactions in amounts relative to the number of votes they have**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a witness turns out to act fraudulently, they can quickly be voted out and replaced by other witnesses. **The top witnesses get paid the most so there is competition to be a good honest witness.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The delegated proof of stake model also has a group called the **delegates, who are trusted parties that manage the operation of a network** but don't take part in transaction validation and block production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of Importance:**<br>\n",
    "This one is much like proof of stake in that those with a greater share of currency have a greater probability to forge blocks. However, some more variables are thrown in the mix, which give each node a combined score and that score is used to determine their share of forging probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The variables used could be anything judged to be healthy for the network. Maybe you want to favor nodes that have more recent transaction activity or perhaps you'd like to punish currency hoarding by decreasing the reward a forger gets if they possess two concentrated a share of the network's wealth.** These are all options under proof of importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kinds of Networks (Blockchain types)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the blockchains we've been talking about so far have been public blockchains. Bitcoin and Ethereum are open public networks that anyone can join. All networks aren't like this, blockchains come in many varieties. When it comes to who is allowed to access them, there are three types.\n",
