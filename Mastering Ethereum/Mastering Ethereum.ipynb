    "Recommended Watch: [Ethereum Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Qs0XdPpw8)<br>\n",
    "Corresponding Read: [Ethereum Explained ipynb](https://github.com/llSourcell/ethereum_demo/blob/master/Ethereum%20Explained.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum is \"the World Computer\"**. That’s one of the more common descriptions of the Ethereum platform. But what does that mean? Let’s try to start with a computer science focused description, and then try to decipher that with a more practical analysis of Ethereum’s capabilities and characteristics, while comparing it to Bitcoin and other **decentralized information exchange platforms (or \"blockchains\" for short)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a computer science perspective, **Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state-machine with two basic functions**: \n",
    "- the first being **a globally accessible singleton state**, and\n",
    "- the second being **a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.**\n",
    "\n",
    "From a more practical perspective, **Ethereum is an open-source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called \"smart contracts\". It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system \"state\" changes, along with a cryptocurrency called \"ether\" to meter and constrain execution resource costs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Ethereum platform **enables developers to build powerful decentralized applications with built-in economic functions**. While providing continuous uptime, it also reduces or eliminates censorship, third party interface, and counterparty risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people will come to Ethereum with some prior experience of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin. <br>**Ethereum shares many common elements with other open blockchains**:\n",
    "- a peer-to-peer network connecting participants, \n",
    "- a byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus algorithm for synchronization of state updates (a proof-of-work blockchain), and \n",
    "- a digital currency (ether).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of a blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of an open, public, blockchain are (usually):\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **peer-to-peer network** connecting participants and propagating transactions and blocks of verified transactions, based on a standardized \"gossip\" protocol.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Messages, in the form of transactions**, representing state transitions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A set of **consensus rules**, governing what constitutes a transaction and what makes for valid state transition.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **state machine** that processes transactions according to the consensus rules.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **chain of cryptographically secured blocks**, that acts as a journal of all the verified and accepted state transitions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **consensus algorithm** that decentralizes control over the blockchain, by forcing participants to cooperate in the enforcement of the consensus rules.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **game-theoretically sound incentivization scheme** (e.g. proof-of-work costs plus block rewards) to economically secure the state machine in an open environment.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- One or more **open-source software implementations of the above (\"clients\")**.\n",
    "\n",
    "All or most of these components are usually combined in a single software client. For example, in Bitcoin, the reference implementation is developed by the Bitcoin Core open source project, and implemented as the **bitcoind client**.<br>\n",
    "**In Ethereum, rather than a reference implementation, there is a \"reference specification\", a mathematical description of the system in the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)**. There are a number of clients, which are built according to the reference specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, <u>we used the term \"blockchain\" to represent all of the components above, as a short-hand reference to the combination of technologies that encompass all of the characteristics described </u>. Today, however, **the term blockchain has become diluted by marketers and profiteers**, looking to hype their projects and attain unrealistic valuations for their startups. It is effectively meaningless on its own. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**We need qualifiers to help us understand the characteristics of the blockchain in question, such as open, public, global, decentralized, neutral, and censorship-resistant,** to identify the important emergent characteristics of a \"blockchain\" system that these components allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Not all blockchains are created equal</u>. **When you are told that something is a blockchain, you have not received an answer; rather, you need to start asking a lot of questions to clarify what they mean when they use the word \"blockchain\"**. Start by asking for a description of the components above, then ask about whether this \"blockchain\" exhibits the characteristics of being open, public, etc..?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development of Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, both the purpose and construction of Ethereum are strikingly different from the open blockchains that preceded it, including Bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum’s purpose is not primarily a digital currency payment network. While the digital currency ether is both integral and necessary for the operation of Ethereum, ether is intended as a utility currency to pay for use of the Ethereum platform as the \"World Computer\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Bitcoin, which has a very limited scripting language, <u>Ethereum is designed to be a general purpose programmable blockchain that runs a virtual machine capable of executing code of arbitrary and unbounded complexity</u>. Where Bitcoin’s Script language is, intentionally, constrained to simple true/false evaluation of spending conditions, **Ethereum’s language is Turing Complete, meaning that it is equivalent to a general purpose computer that can run any computation that a theoretical Turing Machine can run.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Birth of Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "All great innovations solve real problems, Ethereum is no exception. Ethereum was conceived at a time when people recognized the power of the Bitcoin model, and were trying to move beyond cryptocurrency applications and into other projects. But developers faced a conundrum: they either needed to build on top of Bitcoin or start a new blockchain. **Building upon Bitcoin meant living within the intentional constraints of the network and trying to find workarounds. The limited types and sizes of data storage seemed to limit the types of applications that could run on top, as second layer solutions**. Programmers needed to build systems that utilized only the limited set of variables, transaction types, and data. **For projects that needed more freedom, more flexibility, starting a new blockchain was the only option. But starting a new blockchain meant a lot of work: bootstrapping all the infrastructure elements, exhaustive testing, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end of 2013, Vitalik Buterin, a young programmer and Bitcoin enthusiast, started thinking about further extending the capabilities of Bitcoin and Mastercoin (an overlay protocol that extended Bitcoin to offer rudimentary smart contracts). In October of 2013, Vitalik proposed a more generalized approach to the Mastercoin team, one that allowed flexible and scriptable (but not Turing complete) contracts to replace the specialized contract language of Mastercoin. While the Mastercoin team was impressed, this proposal was too radical a change to fit into their development roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In December 2013, Vitalik started sharing a white paper which outlined the idea behind Ethereum: a Turing complete programmable and general purpose blockchain. A few dozen people saw this early draft and offered feedback to Vitalik, helping him gradually evolve the proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the authors of this book received an early draft copy of the white paper and commented on it. Andreas M. Antonopoulos was intrigued by the idea and asked Vitalik many questions about the use of a separate blockchain to enforce consensus rules on smart contract execution and the implications of a Turing complete language. Andreas continued to follow Ethereum’s progress with great interest but was in the early stages of writing his book \"Mastering Bitcoin\" and did not participate directly in Ethereum until much later. Dr. Gavin Wood, however, was one of the first people to reach out to Vitalik and offer to help with his C++ programming skills. Gavin became Ethereum’s co-founder, co-designer and CTO.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Vitalik recounts in his \"Ethereum Prehistory\" post:<br>\n",
    "This was the time when the Ethereum protocol was entirely my own creation. From here on, however, new participants started to join the fold. By far the most prominent on the protocol side was Gavin Wood. **Gavin can also be largely credited for the subtle change in vision from viewing Ethereum as a platform for building programmable money, with blockchain-based contracts that can hold digital assets and transfer them according to pre-set rules, to a general-purpose computing platform.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This started with subtle changes in emphasis and terminology, and <u>later this influence became stronger with the increasing emphasis on the “Web 3” ensemble, which saw Ethereum as being one piece of a suite of decentralized technologies, the other two being Whisper and Swarm.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in December 2013, Vitalik and Gavin refined and evolved the idea, together building the protocol layer that became Ethereum. **Ethereum’s founders were thinking about a blockchain that didn’t aim for a specific purpose, but instead could support a broad variety of applications by being programmed.** \n",
    "> **The idea was that by using a general purpose blockchain like Ethereum, a developer could program their particular application without having to bootstrap the underlying mechanisms of peer-to-peer networks, blockchains, consensus algorithms, etc.** <u>The Ethereum platform was designed to abstract these details and provide a deterministic and secure programming environment for decentralized blockchain applications</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like Satoshi, Vitalik and Gavin didn’t just invent a new technology, they combined new inventions with existing technologies in a novel way and delivered the prototype code to prove their ideas to the world. The founders worked for years, building and refining the vision. And on July 30th 2015, the first Ethereum block was mined. The world’s computer started serving the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vitalik Buterin’s article \"A Prehistory of Ethereum\" was published in September 2017 and provides a fascinating first-person view of Ethereum’s earliest moments. Read it at https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum’s four stages of development\n",
    "\n",
    "The birth of Ethereum was the launch of the first stage, named \"Frontier\". **Ethereum’s development is planned over four distinct stages, with major changes occurring in each new stage. Each stage may include sub-releases, known as \"hard forks\" that change functionality in a way that is not backwards compatible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main development stages are codenamed **Frontier**, **Homestead**, **Metropolis** and **Serenity**. The intermediate hard forks are codenamed \"**Ice Age**\", \"**DAO**\", \"**Tangerine Whistle**\", \"**Spurious Dragon**\", \"**Byzantium**\", and \"**Constantinople**\". They are listed below, by the block number in which the hard fork occurred:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Past transitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #0<br>\n",
    "**\"Frontier\"** - The initial stage of Ethereum, lasted from July 30th 2015 to March 2016.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #200,000<br>\n",
    "\"Ice Age\" - A hard fork to introduce an exponential difficulty increase, to motivate a transition to Proof-of-Stake when ready.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #1,150,000<br>\n",
    "**\"Homestead\"** - The second stage of Ethereum, launched in March 2016.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #1,192,000<br>\n",
    "\"DAO\" - The hard fork that reimbursed victims of the hacked DAO contract and caused Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to split into two competing systems.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #2,463,000<br>\n",
    "\"Tangerine Whistle\" - A hard fork to change the gas calculation for certain IO-heavy operations and to clear the accumulated state from a denial of service attack, which exploited the low gas cost of those operations.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #2,675,000<br>\n",
    "\"Spurious Dragon\" - A hard fork to address more denial of service attack vectors, and another state clearing. Also, a replay attack protection mechanism.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current state**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are currently in the Metropolis stage, which was planned as two sub-release hard forks codenamed **Byzantium** and **Constantinople**. Byzantium went into effect in October 2017 and Constantinople is anticipated by mid-2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #4,370,000<br>\n",
    "**\"Metropolis Byzantium\"** - Metropolis is the third stage of Ethereum, launched in October 2017. Byzantium is the first of two hard forks for Metropolis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future plans**\n",
    "\n",
    "After Metropolis' Byzantium hard fork, there is one more hard fork planned for Metropolis. Metropolis is followed by the final stage of Ethereum’s deployment, codenamed Serenity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constantinople: The second part of the Metropolis stage, planned for mid-2018. Expected to include a switch to hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm, among other changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Serenity**: The fourth and final stage of Ethereum. Serenity does not yet have a planned release date.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum: A general purpose blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "The original blockchain, namely Bitcoin’s blockchain, tracks the state of units of bitcoin and their ownership. \n",
    "> **We can think of bitcoin as a distributed consensus state machine, where transactions cause a global state transition, altering the ownership of coins**. The state transitions are constrained by the rules of consensus, allowing all participants to (eventually) converge on a common (consensus) state of the system, after several blocks are mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum is also a distributed state machine. But instead of tracking only the state of currency ownership, Ethereum tracks the state transitions of a general-purpose data store. By general purpose we mean any data that can be expressed as a key-value tuple.** A key-value data store simply stores any arbitrary value, referenced by some key. For example, storing the value \"Mastering Ethereum\", referenced by the key \"Book Title\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum VS General purpose Computers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarities:<br>\n",
    "- In some ways, tracking the state transitions of a general-purpose data store serves the same purpose as the data storage model of Random Access Memory (RAM) used by a general purpose computer. **Ethereum has memory that stores both code and data and it uses the Ethereum blockchain to track how this memory changes over time**.\n",
    "- Like a general-purpose stored-program computer, **Ethereum can load code into its state machine and run that code, storing the resulting state changes in its blockchain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:<br>\n",
    "Two of the critical differences from a general purpose computer are that \n",
    "- Ethereum **state changes are governed by the rules of consensus**\n",
    "- the **state is distributed globally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum answers the question:<br> **\"What if we could track any arbitrary state and program the state machine to create a world-wide computer operating under consensus?\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethereum’s components\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ethereum, the components of a blockchain system described in [Components of a blockchain](#Components-of-a-blockchain) are, more specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P2P Network**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum runs on the Ethereum Main Network, which is addressable on TCP port 30303, and runs a protocol called **ÐΞVp2p**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consensus rules**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum’s consensus rules, defined in the reference specification, the Ethereum Yellow Paper.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transactions**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum transactions are network messages, that include (among other things) a sender, recipient, value and data payload.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Machine**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum state transitions are processed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a stack-based virtual machine that executes bytecode (machine-language instructions). EVM programs, called \"**smart contracts**\", are written in high-level languages (e.g. **Solidity**) and compiled to bytecode for execution on the EVM.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Structures**<br>\n",
    "<u>Ethereum’s state is stored locally on each node as a database (usually Google’s LevelDB)</u>, which contains the transactions and system state in a serialized hashed data structure called a Merkle Patricia Tree.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consensus Algorithm**<br>\n",
    "<u>Ethereum uses Nakamoto Consensus, i.e. Bitcoin’s consensus model</u>, which uses sequential single-signature blocks, weighted in importance by the Proof-of-Work to determine the longest chain and therefore the current state. However, **there are plans to move to a Proof-of-Stake weighted voting system, codenamed Casper in the near future**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Economic Security**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum currently uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm called **Ethash**, but this will eventually be dropped with the move Proof-of-Stake at some point in the future.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clients**<br>\n",

    "## Ethereum and Turing Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you start reading about Ethereum, you will immediately hear the term \"Turing Complete\". **Ethereum, they say, unlike Bitcoin, is \"Turing Complete\"**. What exactly does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"Turing Complete\" is named after English mathematician Alan Turing who is considered the father of computer science. **In 1936 he created a mathematical model of a computer consisting of a state machine that manipulates symbols, by reading and writing them on sequential memory (resembling an infinite-length magnetic tape)**. With this construct, Alan Turing went on to provide a mathematical foundation to answer (in the negative) questions about universal computability, meaning whether all problems are solvable. **He proved that there are classes of problems that are uncomputable**. Specifically, he proved that the Halting Problem (trying to evaluate whether a program will eventually stop running) is not solvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alan Turing further defined a system to be Turing Complete, if it can be used to simulate any Turing Machine. Such a system is called a **Universal Turing Machine** (UTM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum’s ability to execute a stored program, in a state machine called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, while reading and writing data to memory makes it a Turing Complete system and therefore a Universal Turing Machine**. Ethereum can compute any algorithm that can be computed by any Turing Machine, given the limitations of finite memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ethereum’s groundbreaking innovation is to combine the general-purpose computing architecture of a stored-program computer with a decentralized blockchain, thereby creating a distributed single-state (singleton) world computer**.<br> Ethereum programs run \"everywhere\", yet produce a common (consensus) state that is secured by the rules of consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turing Completeness as a \"feature\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hearing that Ethereum is Turing Complete, you might arrive at the conclusion that this is a feature that is somehow lacking in a system that is Turing Incomplete. Rather, it is the opposite. Turing Completeness is, in some ways, very easy to achieve.** Turing completeness arises in even the simplest state machines. In fact the simplest Turing Complete state machine known (Rogozhin, 1996) has 4 states and uses 6 symbols, with a state definition that is only 22 instructions long. Indeed, sometimes systems are found to be \"Accidentally Turing Complete\". A fun reference of systems that are \"Accidentally Turing Complete\" can be found here: http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/articles/accidentally_turing_complete.html\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **Turing Completeness is very dangerous, particularly in openly accessible systems, like public blockchains**, because of the Halting Problem we touched on earlier. For example, modern printers are Turing Complete and can be given files to print that send them into a frozen state.<br>\n",
    "**The fact that Ethereum is Turing Complete means that any program of any complexity can be computed in Ethereum. But that flexibility brings some thorny security and resource management problems**. An unresponsive printer can be turned off and turned back on again. That is not possible with a public blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications of Turing Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Turing proved that you cannot predict whether a program will terminate, by simulating it on a computer. In simple terms, we cannot predict the path of a program without running it**. Turing Complete systems can run in \"infinite loops\", a term used (in oversimplification) to describe a program that does not terminate. It is trivial to create a program that runs a loop that never ends. But unintended never-ending loops can arise without warning, due to complex interactions between the starting conditions and the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Ethereum, this poses a challenge: every participating node (client), must validate every transaction, running any smart contracts it calls. But as Turing proved, **Ethereum can’t predict if a smart contract will terminate, or how long it will run, without actually running it (possibly running forever)**. Whether by accident, or on purpose, a smart contract can be created such that it runs forever when a node attempts to validate it. **This is effectively a denial of service attack. Of course, between a program that takes a millisecond to validate and one that runs forever there is an infinite range of nasty, resource hogging, memory-bloating, CPU overheating programs that simply waste resources. In a world computer, a program that abuses resources gets to abuse the world’s resources**. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does Ethereum constrain the resources used by a smart contract if it cannot predict resource use in advance?\n",
    ">To answer this challenge, Ethereum introduces a metering mechanism called **gas**. As the EVM executes a smart contract, it carefully accounts for every instruction (computation, data access, etc.). **Each instruction has a pre-determined cost in units of gas. When a transaction triggers the execution of a smart contract, it must include an amount of gas that sets the upper limit of computation that can be consumed running the smart contract. The EVM will terminate execution if the amount of gas consumed by computation exceeds the gas available in the transaction. Gas is the mechanism Ethereum uses to allow Turing Complete computation while limiting the resources that any program can consume.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question is, **'how does one get gas to pay for computation on the Ethereum world computer?'**.\n",
    "> You won’t find gas on any exchanges. **Gas can only be purchased as part of a transaction, and can only be bought with Ether. Ether needs to be sent along with a transaction and it needs to be explicitly ear-marked for the purchase of gas, along with an acceptable gas price**. Just like at the pump station, <u>the price of gas is not fixed</u>. Gas is purchased for the transaction, the computation is executed, and any unused gas is refunded back to the sender of transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that is in direct contrast to Bitcoin, where any series of available scripting functions (and there are not many) can be included in a transaction, as long as the size of the transaction, in bytes, fits the restrictions in place at the time of the transaction. This means that Bitcoin is vulnerable to attack from 'execution bomb' transactions, such as the infamous \"three minute tx\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015 an **attacker exploited an EVM instruction that cost far less gas than it should have**. This allowed the attacker to create transactions that use a lot of memory and take several minutes to validate. **To fix this attack, Ethereum had to change its gas accounting formula for certain instructions in a backwards incompatible (hard fork) change.** Even with this change, however, Ethereum clients have to skip validating these transactions or waste weeks trying to validate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From general purpose blockchains to Decentralized Applications (DApps)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum started as a way to make a general purpose blockchain that could be programmed for a variety of uses. But very quickly, Ethereum’s vision expanded to become a platform for programming Decentralized Applications (DApps)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "DApps represent a broader perspective than \"smart contracts\". **A DApp is, at the very least, a smart contract and a web user-interface. More broadly, a DApp is a web application that is built on top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DApp is composed of at least:\n",
    "- **Smart contracts** on a blockchain.\n",
    "- A **web front-end user-interface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, many DApps include other decentralized components, such as:\n",
    "- A decentralized (P2P) storage protocol and platform.\n",
    "- A decentralized (P2P) messaging protocol and platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You may see DApps spelled as **ÐApps**. The Ð character is the Latin character called \"ETH\", alluding to Ethereum. To display this character, use decimal entity #208 in HTML, and Unicode characters 0xCE (UTF-8), or 0x00D0 (UTF-16).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Third Age of the Internet - WEB 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2004, the term \"Web 2.0\" came to prominence, describing an evolution of the web towards user-generated content, responsive interfaces and interactivity. Web 2.0 is not a technical specification, but rather a term describing the new focus of web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The concept of DApps is meant to take the World Wide Web to its next natural evolution, introducing decentralization with peer-to-peer protocols into every aspect of a web application**. The term used to describe this evolution is **Web3**, meaning the third \"version\" of the web.\n",

    "## Ethereum’s development culture\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we’ve talked about how Ethereum’s goals and technology differ from other blockchains that preceded it, like Bitcoin. Ethereum also has a very different development culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Bitcoin, development is guided by very conservative principles: all changes are carefully studied to ensure that none of the existing systems are disrupted. For the most part, changes are only implemented if they are backwards compatible**. Existing clients are allowed to \"opt-in\", but will continue to operate if they decide not to upgrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Ethereum, by comparison, the development culture is focused on the future rather than the past. The (not entirely serious) mantra is \"move fast and break things\". If a change is needed, it is implemented, even if that means invalidating prior assumptions, breaking compatibility, or forcing clients to update. Ethereum’s development culture is characterized by rapid innovation, rapid evolution and a willingness to deploy forward-looking improvements, even if this is at the expense of some backwards incompatibility.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means to you as a developer, is that you must remain flexible and be prepared to rebuild your infrastructure as some of the underlying assumptions change. **One of the big challenges facing developers in Ethereum is the inherent contradiction between deploying code to an immutable system and a development platform that is still evolving. You can’t simply \"upgrade\" your smart contracts. You must be prepared to deploy new ones, migrate users, apps and funds, and start over.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Ironically, this also means that the goal of building systems with more autonomy and less centralized control is still not fully realized</u>. Autonomy and decentralization requires a bit more stability in the platform than you’re likely to get in Ethereum in the next few years. **In order to \"evolve\" the platform, you have to be ready to scrap and restart your smart contracts, which means you have to retain a certain degree of control over them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**But, on the positive side, Ethereum is moving forward very fast**. There’s very little opportunity for \"**bike-shedding**\" - an expression that means holding up development by arguing over minor details such as how to build the bicycle shed at the back of a nuclear power station. If you start bike-shedding, you might suddenly discover the rest of the development team changed the plan, and ditched bicycles in favor of autonomous hovercrafts.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Eventually, the development of the Ethereum platform slow down and its interfaces will become fixed. **But in the meantime, innovation is the driving principle. You’d better keep up, because no one will slow down for you.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learn Ethereum?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blockchains have a very steep learning curve, as they combine multiple disciplines into one domain: programming, information security, cryptography, economics, distributed systems, peer-to-peer networks etc. Ethereum makes this learning curve a lot less steep, so you can get started very quickly**. But just below the surface of a deceptively simple environment, lies a lot more. As you learn and start looking deeper, there’s always another layer of complexity and wonder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum is a great platform for learning about blockchains and it’s building a massive community of developers, faster than any other blockchain platform. **More than any other blockchain, Ethereum is a developer’s blockchain, built by developers, for developers**. A developer familiar with JavaScript applications can drop into Ethereum and start producing working code very quickly. For the first years of Ethereum, it was common to see t-shirts announcing that you can create a token in just five lines of code. Of course, this is a double-edged sword. **It’s easy to write code, but it’s very hard to write good and secure code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook will teach you?\n",

    "# Ethereum Clients\n",
    "\n",
    "**An Ethereum client is a software application that implements the Ethereum specification and communicates over the peer-to-peer network with other Ethereum clients. Different Ethereum clients interoperate if they comply with the reference specification and the standardized communications protocols.** While these different clients are implemented by different teams and in different programming languages, they all \"speak\" the same protocol and follow the same rules. As such, they can all be used to operate and interact with the same Ethereum network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum is an open source project and the source code for all the major clients are available under open source licenses (e.g. LGPL v3.0), so they are free to download and use for any purpos**e. Open source means more than simply free to use. It also means that Ethereum is developed by an open community of volunteers and can be modified by anyone. More eyes means more trustworthy code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum is defined by a formal specification called the \"**Yellow Paper**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to, for example, Bitcoin, which is not defined in any formal way. **Where Bitcoin’s \"specification\" is the reference implementation Bitcoin Core, Ethereum’s specification is documented in a paper that combines an English and a mathematical (formal) specification. This formal specification, in addition to various Ethereum Improvement Proposals, defines the standard behavior of an Ethereum client**. The Yellow Paper is periodically updated as major changes are made to Ethereum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a result of Ethereum’s clear formal specification, there are a number of independently developed, yet interoperable, software implementations of an Ethereum client**. Ethereum has a greater diversity of implementations running on the network than any other blockchain, which is generally regarded as a good thing. Indeed, it has, for example, proven itself to be an excellent way of defending against attacks on the network, because exploitation of a particular client’s implementation strategy simply hassles the developers while they patch the exploit, while other clients keep the network running almost unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**There exist a variety of Ethereum-based networks which largely conform to the formal specification defined in the Ethereum \"Yellow Paper,\" but which may or may not interoperate with each other.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these Ethereum-based networks are: **Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ella, Expanse, Ubiq, Musicoin**, and many others.<u> While mostly compatible on a protocol-level, these networks often have features or attributes that require maintainers of Ethereum client software to make small changes in order to support each network. Because of this, not every version of Ethereum client software runs every Ethereum-based blockchain </u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are six main implementations of the Ethereum protocol (Ethereum Clients) written in six different languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parity**, written in Rust<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geth**, written in Go<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cpp-ethereum**, written in C++<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pyethereum**, written in Python<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mantis**, written in Scala,<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Harmony**, written in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will look at the two most common clients, Parity and Geth. We’ll learn to set up a node using each client and explore some of their command-line and application programming interfaces (APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Should I run a full node?\n",
    "\n",
    "The health, resilience, and censorship resistance of blockchains depend on having many independently operated and geographically dispersed full nodes. **Each full node can help other new nodes obtain the block data to bootstrap their operation, as well as offer the operator an authoritative and independent verification of all transactions and contracts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, running a full node will incur a cost in hardware resources and bandwidth**. A full node must download more than 80GB of data (as of April 2018; depending on client) and store it on a local hard drive. This data burden increases quite rapidly every day as new transactions and blocks are added. More on this topic in Hardware Requirements for a Full Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A full node running on a live mainnet network is not necessary for Ethereum development. You can do almost everything you need to do**:\n",
    "- with a testnet node (which connects you to one of the smaller public test blockchains), \n",
    "- with a local private blockchain, or \n",
    "- with a cloud-based Ethereum client offered by a service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You also have the option of running a \"remote client\" which does not store a local copy of the blockchain or validate blocks and transactions. These clients offer the functionality of a wallet and can create and broadcast transactions**. Remote clients can be used to connect to existing networks, such as your own full node, a public blockchain, a public or permissioned (PoA) testnet, or a private local blockchain. In practice, you will likely use a remote client such as **MetaMask, Emerald Wallet, MyEtherWallet** or **MyCrypto** as a convenient way to switch between all of the different node options.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The terms \"**remote client**\" and \"**wallet**\" are used interchangeably, though there are some differences. Usually, a remote client offers an API (such as the web3js API) in addition to the transaction functionality of a wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not confuse the concept of a remote wallet in Ethereum with that of a light client (which is analogous to a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) client in Bitcoin). <br>\n",
    "**Light clients (SPV) validate block headers and use Merkle proofs to validate the inclusion of transactions in the blockchain and determine their effects, rendering them of a similar level of security to a full node. Conversely, Ethereum remote clients do not validate block headers or transactions. They entirely trust a full client operated by a third party (which could be you) to give them RPC access to the blockchain and as such lose significant security and anonymity guarantees.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Node Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing to run a full node helps with the operation of the networks you connect it to, but also incurs some mild to moderate costs for you. Let’s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports the resilience and censorship resistance of Ethereum-based networks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authoritatively validates all transactions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can interact with any contract on the public blockchain (without requiring an intermediary).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can query (read-only) the blockchain status (accounts, contracts, etc.) offline, if necessary.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can query the blockchain without letting a third party know the information you’re reading.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can directly deploy your own contracts into the public blockchain (without requiring an intermediary).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires significant and growing hardware and bandwidth resources.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires several hours or days to fully sync for the first initial download.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Must be maintained, upgraded and kept online to remain synced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Testnet Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Whether or not you choose to run a full node, you will probably want to run a public testnet node.** Let’s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a public testnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A testnet node needs to sync and store much less data, ~10GB depending on the network (as of April 2018).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A testnet node can sync fully in a few hours.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploying contracts or making transactions requires test ether, which has no value and can be acquired for free from several \"faucets\".<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testnets are public blockchains with many other users and contracts, running \"live.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can’t use \"real\" money on a testnet, it runs on test ether.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consequently, you can’t test security against real adversaries, as there is nothing at stake.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are some aspects of a public blockchain that you cannot test realistically on testnet. For example, transaction fees, although necessary to send transactions, are not a consideration on testnet since gas is free. And the testnets do not experience network congestion like the public mainnet sometimes does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Instance (ganache) Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "For many testing purposes, the best option is to launch a single instance private blockchain, using the ganache local test blockchain. **Ganache (formerly named testrpc) creates a local-only, private blockchain that you can interact with, without any other participants**. It shares many of the advantages and disadvantages of the public testnet, but also has some differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- No syncing and almost no data on disk. You mine the first block yourself.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- No need to find test ether, you \"award\" yourself mining rewards that you can use for testing.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- No other users, just you.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- No other contracts, just the ones you deploy after you launch it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having no other users means that it doesn’t behave the same as a public blockchain. There’s no competition for transaction space or sequencing of transactions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- No miners other than you means that mining is more predictable, therefore you can’t test some scenarios that occur on a public blockchain.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having no other contracts means you have to deploy everything that you want to test, including dependencies and contract libraries.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can’t recreate some of the public contracts and their addresses to test some scenarios (e.g. the DAO contract).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running an Ethereum client\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",
    "> Instead of compiling the source code of the Ethereum client, which would require installation of multiple support libraries (as can be seen in the demonstration below), **simply go to the corresponding official website of that client and grab the executables/pre-compiled binaries**.<br>\n",
    "Ex: Geth executables can be installed from https://geth.ethereum.org/ instead of going to Geth's github repo, cloning and building executables from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the time and resources, you should attempt to run a full node, even if only to learn more about the process. **In the next few sections we will download, compile, and run the Ethereum clients Parity and Geth. This requires some familiarity with using the command-line interface on your operating system. It’s worth installing these clients whether you choose to run them as full nodes, as testnet nodes, or as clients to a local private blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Requirements for a Full Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, you should ensure you have a computer with sufficient resources to run an Ethereum full node. You will need at least 80GB of disk space to store a full copy of the Ethereum blockchain. If you also want to run a full node on the Ethereum testnet, you will need at least an additional 15GB. Downloading 80GB of blockchain data can take a long time, so it’s recommended that you work on a fast Internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syncing the Ethereum blockchain is very input-output (I/O) intensive. It is best to have a Solid-State Drive (SSD). If you have a mechanical hard disk drive (HDD), you will need at least 8GB of RAM to use as cache. Otherwise, you may discover that your system is too slow to keep up and sync fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- CPU with 2+ cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At least 80GB free storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4GB RAM minimum with a SSD, 8GB+ if you have an HDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 8 MBit/sec download Internet service.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the minimum requirements to sync a full (but pruned) copy of an Ethereum-based blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing (April 2018) the Parity codebase is lighter on resources, so if you’re running with limited hardware you’ll likely see the better results using Parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to sync in a reasonable amount of time and store all the development tools, libraries, clients, and blockchains we discuss in this book, you will want a more capable computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Specifications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast CPU with 4+ cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 16GB+ RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast SSD with at least 500GB free space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s difficult to predict how fast a blockchain’s size will increase and when more disk space will be required, so it’s recommended to check the blockchain’s latest size before you start syncing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we may need to get some prerequisites satisfied. If you’ve never done any software development on the computer you are currently using, you will probably need to install some basic tools. For the examples that follow, you will need to install:\n",

    "\n",
    "> Geth requirements vary, but if you stick with Go version 1.10 or greater you should be able to compile any version of Geth you want. Of course, you should always refer to the documentation for your chosen flavor of Geth.<br><br>\n",
    "The version of golang that is installed on your operating system or is available from your system’s package manager may be significantly older than 1.10. If so, remove it and install the latest version from golang.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust can be installed by following the instructions here: https://www.rustup.rs/\n",
    "\n",
    "> Parity requires Rust version 1.24 or greater.\n",

    "`sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev libudev-dev`\n",
    "\n",
    "For other operating systems, use the package manager of your OS or follow the Wiki instructions (https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Setup) to install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have git, golang, rust, and necessary libraries installed, let’s get to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parity is an implementation of a full node Ethereum client and DApp browser. Parity was written from the \"ground up\" in Rust, a systems programming language with the aim of building a modular, secure, and scalable Ethereum client**. Parity is developed by Parity Tech, a UK company, and is released under a GPLv3 open source license.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Disclosure: One of the authors of this book, Gavin Wood, is the founder of Parity Tech and wrote much of the Parity client. Parity represents about 28% of the installed Ethereum client base.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Parity, you can use the Rust package manager cargo or download the source code from GitHub. The package manager also downloads the source code, so there’s not much difference between the two options. In the next section, we will show you how to download and compile Parity yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing Parity**<br>\n",
    "The Parity Wiki offers instructions for building Parity in different environments and containers:\n",
    "https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll build Parity from source. This assumes you have already installed Rust using rustup.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s get the source code from GitHub:<br>\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/paritytech/parity`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s change to the parity directory and use cargo to build the executable:<br>\n",
    "`cd parity` <br>\n",
    "`cargo build`\n",
    "\n",
    "If all goes well, you should see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BuildingParity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now that Parity is installed, we can sync the blockchain and get started with some basic command-line options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go-Ethereum (Geth)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geth is the Go language implementation, which is actively developed by the Ethereum Foundation, so is considered the \"official\" implementation of the Ethereum client. Typically, every Ethereum-based blockchain will have its own Geth implementation**. If you’re running Geth, then you’ll want to make sure you grab the correct version for your blockchain using one of the repository links below.\n",

    "> **You can also skip these instructions and install a precompiled binary for your platform of choice. The precompiled releases are much easier to install and can be found at the \"release\" section of the repositories above**. However, you may learn more by downloading and compiling the software yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloning the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to clone the git repository, so as to get a copy of the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a local clone of this repository, use the git command as follows, in your home directory or under any directory you use for development:<br>\n",
    "`git clone <Repository Link>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now that we have a local copy of Geth, we can compile an executable for our platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building Geth from Source Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To build Geth, change to the directory where the source code was downloaded and use the make command:<br>\n",
    "` cd go-ethereum`<br>\n",
    "`make geth`\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Buildin-Geth.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your geth version command may show slightly different information, but you should see a version report much like the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we may want to copy the geth command to our operating system’s application directory (or a directory on the command-line execution path). On Linux, we’d use the following command:<br>\n",
    "`sudo cp ./build/bin/geth /usr/local/bin`\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t start running geth yet, because it will start synchronizing the blockchain \"the slow way,\" and that will take far too long (weeks). The First Synchronization of Ethereum-based Blockchains explains the challenge with the initial synchronization of Ethereum’s blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The First Synchronization of Ethereum-based Blockchains\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normally, when syncing an Ethereum blockchain, your client will download and validate every block and every transaction since the very start, i.e. from the genesis block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to fully sync the blockchain this way, the sync will take a very long time and has high computing resource requirements (much more RAM and faster storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many Ethereum-based blockchains were the victim of a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack at the end of 2016. Blockchains affected by this attack will tend to sync slowly when doing a full sync.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, **on Ethereum, a new client will make rapid progress until it reaches block 2,283,397. This block was mined on 2016/09/18 and marks the beginning of the DoS attacks. From this block and until block 2,700,031 (2016/11/26), the validation of transactions becomes extremely slow, memory intensive, and I/O intensive**. This results in validation times exceeding 1 minute per block. Ethereum implemented a series of upgrades, using hard forks, to address the underlying vulnerabilities that were exploited in the denial of service attacks. These upgrades also cleaned up the blockchain by removing some 20 million empty accounts created by spam transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are syncing with full validation, your client will slow down and may take several days, or perhaps even longer, to validate the blocks affected by this DoS attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fortunately, most Ethereum clients include an option to perform a \"fast\" synchronization that skips the full validation of transactions until it has synced to the tip of the blockchain, then resumes full validation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For Geth, the option to enable fast synchronization is typically called --fast. You may need to refer to the specific instructions for your chosen Ethereum chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Parity, the option is --warp for older versions (< 1.6) and is enabled by default (no need to set a configuration option) on newer versions (>= 1.6).\n",
    "\n",

    "### JSON-RPC Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum clients offer an Application Programming Interface (API) and a set of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) commands, which are encoded as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You will see this referred to as the JSON-RPC API. Essentially, the JSON-RPC API is an interface that allows us to write programs that use an Ethereum client as a gateway into an Ethereum network and blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Usually, the RPC interface is offered over as an HTTP service on port 8545. For security reasons it is restricted, by default, to only accept connections from localhost (the IP address of your own computer which is 127.0.0.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the JSON-RPC API:\n",
    "- you can **use a specialized library**, written in the programming language of your choice, which provides \"stub\" function calls corresponding to each available RPC command. \n",
    "- Or, you can **manually construct HTTP requests and send/receive JSON encoded requests**. You can even use a generic command-line HTTP client, like curl, to call the RCP interface. Let’s try that. First, ensure that you have Geth configured and running, then switch to a new terminal window.\n",

    "In this example, we use curl to make an HTTP connection to address http://localhost:8545. We are already running geth, which offers the JSON-RPC API as an HTTP service on port 8545. We instruct curl to use the HTTP POST command and to identify the content as Content-Type: application/json. Finally, we pass a JSON-encoded request as the data component of our HTTP request. Most of our command line is just setting up curl to make the HTTP connection correctly. The interesting part is the actual JSON-RPC command we issue:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "> **The id parameter is used primarily when you are making multiple requests in a single JSON-RPC call, a practice called batching. Batching is used to avoid the overhead of a new HTTP and TCP connection for every request**. In the Ethereum context for example, we would use batching if we wanted to retrieve thousands of transactions in one HTTP connection. When batching, you set a different id for each request and then match it to the id in each response from the JSON-RPC server. The easiest way to implement this is to maintain a counter and increment the value for each request.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Some remote clients, for example mobile (smartphone) wallets, offer only basic wallet functionality. Other remote clients are fully-developed DApp browsers**. Remote clients commonly offer some of the functions of a full node Ethereum client without synchronizing a local copy of the Ethereum blockchain by connecting to a full node being run elsewhere, e.g. by you locally on your machine or on a web server, or by a third party on their servers.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Control and responsibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open blockchains like Ethereum are important because they operate as a decentralized system. That means lots of things, but one crucial aspect is that each user of Ethereum can—and should—control their own private keys, which are the things that control access to funds and smart contracts.** We sometimes call the combination of access to funds and smart contracts an \"**account**\" or \"**wallet**\". These terms can get quite complex in their functionality, so we will go into this in more detail later. As a fundamental principle, however, it is as easy as one private key equals one \"account\". Some users choose to give up control over their private keys by using a third party custodian, such as an online exchange. Here, we will learn you how to take control and manage your own private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With control comes a big responsibility. If you lose your private keys, you lose access to funds and contracts**. No one can help you regain access—your funds will be locked forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a **few tips to help you manage this responsibility**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not improvise security. Use tried-and-tested standard approaches.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The more important the account (e.g. the higher the value of the funds controlled, or the more significant the smart contracts accessible), the higher security measures should be taken.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The highest security is gained from an air-gapped device, but this level is not required for every account.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Never store your private key in plain form, especially digitally. Fortunately, most user interfaces today won’t even let you see the raw private key.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Private keys can be stored in an encrypted form, as a digital \"keystore\" file. Being encrypted, they need a password to unlock. When you are prompted to choose a password, make it strong (i.e. long and random), back it up and don’t share it. If you don’t have a password manager, write it down and store it in a safe and secret place. To access your account, you need both the \"keystore\" file and the password.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not store any passwords in digital documents, digital photos, screenshots, online drives, encrypted PDFs, etc. Again, do not improvise security. Use a password manager or pen and paper.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you are prompted to back up a key as a mnemonic word sequence, use pen and paper to make a physical backup. Do not leave that task for \"later\"; you will forget. These can be used to rebuild your private key in case you lose all data saved on your system, or if you forget or lose your password. However, they can also be used by attackers to get your private keys, and so never store them digitally, and keep the physical copy stored securely in a locked drawer or safe.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before transferring any large amounts (especially to new addresses), first do a small test transaction (e.g. less than 1 USD value) and wait for confirmation of receipt.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you create a new account, start by sending only a small test transaction to the new address. Once you receive the test transaction, try sending back again from that account. There are lots of reasons account creation can go wrong, and if it has gone wrong, it is better to find out with a small loss. If sending the test back works, all is well.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public block explorers are an easy way to independently see whether a transaction has been accepted by the network. However, this convenience has a negative impact on your privacy, because you reveal your addresses to block explorers, which can track you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ether currency units\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum’s currency unit is called ether, identified also as \"ETH\" or with the symbols Ξ (from the Greek letter \"Xi\" that looks like a stylized capital E) or, less often, ♦,** for example, 1 ether, or 1 ETH, or Ξ1, or ♦1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Use Unicode character 926 for Ξ and 9830 for ♦.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ether is subdivided into smaller units, down to the smallest unit possible, which is named **wei**. **One ether is 1 quintillion wei** (1 x $10^{18}$ or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000). You may hear people refer to the currency \"Ethereum\" too, but this is a common beginner’s mistake. **Ethereum is the system, ether is the currency.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The value of ether is always represented internally in Ethereum as an unsigned integer value denominated in wei**. When you transact 1 ether, the transaction encodes 10000000000000000000 wei as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ether’s various denominations have both a scientific name using the International System of units (SI), and a colloquial name that pays homage/respect to many of the great minds of computing and cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following table shows the various units, their colloquial (common) name, and their SI name. In keeping with the internal representation of value, the table shows all denominations in wei (first row), with ether shown as $10^{18}$ wei in the 7th row:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EtherDenom&UnitNames.png)\n",

    "## Choosing an Ethereum wallet\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"wallet\" has come to mean many things, although they are all related and on a day-to-day basis they are pretty much the same thing. We will use the term \"wallet\" to mean a software application that helps you manage your Ethereum account. In short, **an Ethereum wallet is your gateway to the Ethereum system. It holds your keys and can create and broadcast transactions on your behalf**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing an Ethereum wallet can be difficult because there are many different options with different features and designs. Some are more suitable for beginners and some are more suitable for experts. Even if you choose one that you like now, you might decide to switch to a different wallet later on. **The Ethereum platform itself is still being improved and the \"best\" wallets are often the ones that adapt to the changes that come with the platform upgrades**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But don’t worry! If you choose a wallet and don’t like how it works, you can change wallets quite easily. **All you have to do is make a transaction that sends your funds from the old wallet to the new wallet, or move the keys by exporting and importing your private keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will choose three different types of wallets to use as examples throughout: a mobile wallet, a desktop wallet, and a web-based wallet. We’ve chosen these three wallets because they represent a broad range of complexity and features. However, the selection of these wallets is not an endorsement of their quality or security. They are simply a good starting place for demonstrations and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that for wallet application to work, it must have access to your private keys, so it is vital that you only download and use wallet applications from sources you can trust. **Fortunately, in general, the more popular a wallet application is, the more trustworthy it is likely to be**. Nevertheless, **it is good practice to avoid \"putting all your eggs in one basket\"** rather have your Ethereum accounts spread across a couple of wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starter wallets:\n",

    "Once we’ve received our first test ether from the Ropsten Test Faucet, we will experiment with sending ether, by trying to send some back to the faucet. As you can see on the Ropsten Test Faucet page, there is an option to \"donate\" 1 ETH to the faucet. This option is available so that once you’re done testing, you can return the remainder of your test ether, so that someone else can use it next. Even though test ether has no value, some people hoard it, making it difficult for everyone else to use the test networks. Hoarding test ether is frowned upon!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we are not test ether hoarders and we want to practice sending ether anyway.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Oops! You probably noticed you can’t complete the transaction. **MetaMask says \"Insufficient balance for transaction\". At first glance this may seem confusing: we have 1 ETH, we want to send 1 ETH, why is MetaMask saying we have insufficient funds?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is because of the cost of gas.<br>**Every Ethereum transaction requires payment of a fee, which is collected by the miners to validate the transaction. The fees in Ethereum are charged in a virtual currency called gas. You pay for the gas with ether, as part of the transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fees are required on the test networks too. Without fees, a test network would behave differently from the main network, making it an inadequate testing platform. **Fees also protect the test networks from denial of service attacks and poorly constructed contracts (e.g. infinite loops), much like they protect the main network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you sent the transaction, **MetaMask calculated the average gas price of recent successful transactions at 3 GWEI**, which stands for 3 gigawei. Wei is the smallest subdivision of the ether currency, as we discussed in Ether currency units. **The gas cost of sending a basic transaction is 21000 gas units. Therefore, the maximum amount of ETH you spend is 3 * 21000 GWEI = 63000 GWEI = 0.000063 ETH**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be advised that average gas prices can fluctuate as they are predominantly determined by miners**. We will see later how you can increase/decrease your gas limit to ensure your transaction takes precedence if need be.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this to say: to make a 1 ETH transaction costs 1.000063 ETH. MetaMask confusingly rounds that down to 1 ETH when showing the total, but the actual amount you need is 1.000063 ETH and you only have 1 ETH. Click \"Reject\" to cancel this transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get some more test ether! Click on the green \"request 1 ether from the faucet\" button again and wait a few seconds. Don’t worry, the faucet should have plenty of ether and will give you more if you ask.\n",

    "Once you have a balance of 2 ETH, you can try again. This time, when you click on the orange \"1 ether\" donation button, you have sufficient balance to complete the transaction. Click \"Submit\" when MetaMask pops-up the payment window. After all of this, you should see a balance of 0.999937 ETH because you sent 1 ETH to the faucet with 0.000063 ETH in gas.\n",

    "## Introducing the world computer\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve created a wallet and we’ve sent and received ether. So far, we’ve treated Ethereum as a cryptocurrency. But Ethereum is much, much more. In fact, the cryptocurrency function is subservient to Ethereum’s function as a world computer; a decentralized smart contract platform. **Ether is meant to be used to pay for running smart contracts, which are computer programs that run on an emulated computer called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EVM is a global singleton, meaning that it operates as if it was a global, single-instance computer, running everywhere.**\n",
    "- **Each node on the Ethereum network runs a local copy of the EVM to validate contract execution**, while\n",
    "- **the Ethereum blockchain records the changing state of this world computer as it processes transactions and smart contracts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of account we created in the MetaMask wallet is called an **Externally Owned Account (EOA). Externally owned accounts are those that have a private key; having the private key means control over access to funds or contracts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you’re probably guessing there is another type of account. **The other type of account is a contract account. A contract account has smart contract code, which a simple EOA can’t have. Furthermore, a contract account does not have a private key. Instead, it is owned (and controlled) by the logic of its smart contract code**: <u>the software program recorded on the Ethereum blockchain at the contract account’s creation and executed by the EVM.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Contracts have an address, just like EOAs. Contracts can send and receive ether, just like EOAs. However, **when a transaction destination is a contract address, it causes that contract to run in the EVM, using the transaction, and the transaction’s data, as its input**.\n",
    "> **In addition to ether, transactions can contain data indicating which specific function in the contract to run and what parameters to pass to that function**. In this way, transactions can call functions within contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that because a contract account does not have a private key, it can not initiate a transaction. Only EOAs can initiate transactions, but contracts can react to transactions by calling other contracts, building complex execution paths.** One typical use of this is an EOA sending a request transaction to a multi-signature smart contract wallet to send some ETH on to another address. A typical DApp programming pattern is to have Contract A calling Contract B in order to maintain a shared state across users of Contract A.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections, we will write our first contract. We will then create, fund, and use that contract with our MetaMask wallet and test ether on the Ropsten test network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A simple contract: a test ether faucet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum has many different high-level languages, all of which can be used to write a contract and produce EVM bytecode.** One high-level language is **by far the dominant language for smart contract programming: Solidity. Solidity was created by Gavin Wood, the co-author of this book and has become the most widely used language in Ethereum and beyond**. We’ll use Solidity to write our first contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example, **we will write a contract that controls a faucet**. We’ve already used a faucet to get test ether on the Ropsten test network. <br> **A faucet is a relatively simple thing: it gives out ether to any address that asks and can be refilled periodically**. You can implement a faucet as a wallet controlled by a human (or a web server), but we will write a Solidity contract that implements a faucet:\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is the code for our contract. Also you can download it from here: [Faucet.sol](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/first_edition/code/Faucet.sol)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Faucet.sol.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple contract, about as simple as we can make it. **It is also a flawed contract, demonstrating a number of bad practices and security vulnerabilities. We will learn by examining all of its flaws in later sections**. But for now, let’s look at what this contract does and how it works, line by line. You will quickly notice that many elements of Solidity are similar to existing programming languages, such as JavaScript, Java or C++\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is a comment:<br>\n",
    "`// Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments are for humans to read and are not included in the executable EVM bytecode.** We usually put them on the line before the code we are trying to explain, or sometimes on the same line. Comments start with two forward slashes //. Everything from the slashes and beyond, until the end of that line, is treated the same as a blank line and ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, the next lines are where our actual contract starts:<br>\n",
    "`contract Faucet {`\n",
    "\n",
    "This line **declares a contract object, similar to a class declaration in other object-oriented languages. The contract definition includes all the lines between the curly braces {} which define a scope**, much like how curly braces are used in many other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we declare the first function of the Faucet contract:<br>\n",
    "`function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {`\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is named withdraw, which takes one **unsigned integer (uint) argument** named withdraw_amount. **It is declared as a public function, meaning it can be called by other contracts**. The function definition follows between curly braces:<br>\n",
    "`require(withdraw_amount <= 100000000000000000);`\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first part of the withdraw function sets a limit on withdrawals. It uses the built-in Solidity function require to test a precondition, that the withdraw_amount is less than or equal to 100000000000000000 wei**, which is the base unit of ether (see Ether Denominations and Unit Names) and equivalent to 0.1 ether. **If the withdraw function is called with a withdraw_amount greater than that amount, the require function here will cause contract execution to stop and fail with an exception. **\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Statements need to be terminated with a semi-colon in Solidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This part of the contract is the main logic of our faucet. It controls the flow of funds out of the contract by placing a limit on withdrawals**. It’s a very simple control but can give you a glimpse of the power of a programmable blockchain: decentralized software controlling money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes the actual withdrawal:<br>\n",
    "`msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);`\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of interesting things are happening here. \n",
    "- The `msg` object is one of the inputs that all contracts can access. It represents the transaction that triggered the execution of this contract. \n",
    "- The attribute `sender` is the sender address of the transaction. \n",
    "- The function `transfer` is a built-in function that transfers ether from the current contract to the address of the sender. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading it backward, this means transfer to the sender of the msg that triggered this contract execution**. The transfer function takes an amount as its only argument. We pass the withdraw_amount value that was the parameter to the withdraw function declared a few lines above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very next line is the closing curly brace, indicating the end of the definition of our withdraw function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we declare one more function:<br>\n",
    "`function () public payable {}`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is a so-called \"**fallback**\" or **default function**, which is **called if the transaction that triggered the contract didn’t name any of the declared functions in the contract, or any function at all, or didn’t contain data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Contracts can have one such default function (without a name) and it is usually the one that receives ether. That’s why it is defined as a public and payable function, which means it can accept ether into the contract. It doesn’t do anything, other than accept the ether, as indicated by the empty definition in the curly brackets {}**. If we make a transaction that sends ether to the contract address, as if it were a wallet, this function will handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right below our default function is the final closing curly bracket, which closes the definition of the contract Faucet. That’s it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling the faucet contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our first example contract, we need to use a Solidity compiler to convert the Solidity code into EVM bytecode, so it can be executed by the EVM on the blockchain itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solidity compiler comes as\n",
    "- a standalone executable \n",
    "- as part of different frameworks, and\n",
    "- bundled in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we will use one of the more popular IDEs, called **Remix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your Chrome browser (with the MetaMask wallet we installed earlier) to navigate to the Remix IDE at:\n",
    "https://remix.ethereum.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you first load Remix, it will start with a sample contract called ballot.sol. We don’t need that, so close it. \n",

    "- Once you have a new tab open, copy and paste the code from our example Faucet.sol:\n",

    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_compile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If something goes wrong, the most likely problem is that Remix IDE is using a version of the Solidity compiler that is different from 0.4.19**. In that case, our pragma directive will prevent Faucet.sol from compiling. To change the compiler version, go to the \"Settings\" tab, set the compiler version to 0.4.19, and try again.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Creating the contract on the blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a contract. We’ve compiled it into bytecode. Now, we need to \"register\" the contract on the Ethereum blockchain. We will be using the Ropsten testnet to test our contract, so that’s the blockchain we want to submit it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Registering a contract on the blockchain involves creating a special transaction, whose destination is the address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, also known as the zero address. The zero address is a special address that tells the Ethereum blockchain that you want to register a contract**. Fortunately, Remix IDE will handle all of that for you and send the transaction to MetaMask.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, switch to the \"Run\" tab and select \"Injected Web3\" in the \"Environment\" drop-down selection box. This connects Remix IDE to the MetaMask wallet, and through MetaMask to the Ropsten Test Network. Once you do that, you can see \"Ropsten\" under Environment.

    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_metamask_create.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have to wait. It will take about 15 to 30 seconds for the contract to be mined on Ropsten. Remix won’t appear to be doing much, but be patient.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_contract_interact.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the Faucet contract now has an address of its own: Remix shows it as Faucet at 0x72e....c7829. The small clipboard symbol to the right allows you to copy the contract address into your clipboard. We will use that in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interacting with the contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far: \n",
    "- Ethereum contracts are programs that control money, which run inside a virtual machine called the EVM. <br><br>\n",
    "- They are created by a special transaction that submits their bytecode to be recorded on the blockchain. <br><br>\n",
    "- Once they are created on the blockchain, they have an Ethereum address, just like wallets. <br><br>\n",
    "- Anytime someone sends a transaction to a contract address it causes the contract to run in the EVM, with the transaction as its input. <br><br>\n",
    "- Transactions sent to contract addresses may have ether or data or both. If they contain ether, it is \"deposited\" to the contract balance. If they contain data, the data can specify a named function in the contract and call it, passing arguments to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Viewing the contract address in a block explorer\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a contract recorded on the blockchain and we can see it has an Ethereum address. Let’s check it out on the ropsten.etherscan.io block explorer and see what a contract looks like. Copy the address of the contract by clicking on the clipboard icon next to its name:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Funding the contract\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the contract only has one transaction in its history: the contract creation transaction. As you can see, the contract also has no ether (zero balance). That’s because we didn’t send any ether to the contract in the creation transaction, even though we could have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s send some ether to the contract! You should still have the address of the contract in your clipboard (if not, copy it again from Remix). Open MetaMask, and send 1 ether to it, exactly as you would any other Ethereum address:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/metamask_send_to_contract.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a minute, if you reload the etherscan block explorer, it will show another transaction to the contract address and an updated balance of 1 ether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the unnamed default public payable function in our Faucet.sol code? It looked like this:<br>\n",
    "`function () public payable {}`\n",
    "\n",
    ">When you sent a transaction to the contract address, with no data specifying which function to call, it called this default function. Because we declared it as a payable, it accepted and deposited the 1 ether into the contract account balance. Your transaction caused the contract to run in the EVM, updating its balance. We have funded our faucet!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Withdrawing from our contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s withdraw some funds from the faucet. **To withdraw, we have to construct a transaction that calls the withdraw function and passes a withdraw_amount argument to it. To keep things simple for now, Remix will construct that transaction for us and MetaMask will present it for our approval.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Return to the Remix tab and look at the contract under the \"Run\" tab. You should see a red box labeled withdraw with a field entry labeled uint256 withdraw_amount :\n",

    "First, let’s figure out the withdraw_amount. We want to try and withdraw 0.1 ether, which is the maximum amount allowed by our contract. Remember that all currency values in Ethereum are denominated in wei internally, and our withdraw function expects the withdraw_amount to be denominated in wei too. The amount we want is 0.1 ether, which is 100000000000000000 wei (1 followed by 17 zeros).\n",

    "- We sent a transaction from our MetaMask wallet that contained data instructions to call the withdraw function with a withdraw_amount argument of 0.1 ether.<br><br>\n",
    "- That transaction caused the contract to run inside the EVM. As the EVM ran the Faucet contract’s withdraw function, first it called the require function and validated that our amount was less than or equal to the maximum allowed withdrawal of 0.1 ether.<br><br>\n",
    "- Then it called the transfer function to send us the ether. Running the transfer function generated an internal transaction that deposited 0.1 ether into our wallet address, from the contract’s balance. That’s the one shown in the \"Internal Transactions\" tab in etherscan.\n",

    "In this section, we’ve set up a wallet using MetaMask and we’ve funded it using a faucet on the Ropsten Test Network. We received ether into our wallet’s Ethereum address. Then we sent ether to the faucet’s Ethereum address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we wrote a faucet contract in Solidity. We used the Remix IDE to compile the contract into EVM bytecode. We used Remix to form a transaction and created the faucet contract on the Ropsten blockchain. Once created, the faucet contract had an Ethereum address and we sent it some ether. Finally, we constructed a transaction to call the withdraw function and successfully asked for 0.1 ether. The contract checked our request and sent us 0.1 ether with an internal transaction.\n",

    "# Ethereum Test Networks (Testnets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This section isn't complete yet and would be updated with appropriate content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a testnet?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A test network (testnet for short) is used to simulate the behavior of the main Ethereum network**. There are some publicly available test networks that are simply alternative Ethereum blockchains. **The currency on these networks is worthless, but they are still useful since the functionality of contracts and protocol changes can be tested without disrupting the main Ethereum network or using real money**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> When any major change to the Ethereum protocol is about to be included in the main network (mainnet for short), its tests are mostly done on these test networks. **These test networks are also used by a large number of developers for testing applications before deploying them onto the main network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Testnets\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can either connect to publicly available test networks or spawn a private test network of your own**. First, let’s use a public testnet for easier setup. To use a public testnet requires some testnet ether and a connection to that network. **For testnet ether, \"faucets\" are used, which distribute test ether slowly, \"dripping\" out a small amount to anyone who asks. To connect to a testnet, you need an Ethereum client, either a full client such as geth, or a gateway to a full client, such as MetaMask.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Test Ether\n",
    "\n",
    "Since testnets do not operate with real money, **the incentive to secure the testnets by miners is low. Therefore, the testnets must protect themselves from abuse and attacks differently**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**As a result, faucets were created for these testnets to distribute free test ether to developers in a controlled manner (most faucets 'drip' ether at 1 ether every few seconds or so)**. This controlled distribution of ether prevents users from abusing the chain since giving a limited supply of ether prevents them from writing too much to the chain or executing too many transactions. <u>Additionally, some testnets have implemented **Proof of Authentication schemes**, where using a faucet requires authentication from a social media site with proper credentials</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to Testnets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metamask\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metamask fully supports the Ropsten, Kovan and Rinkeby testnets, but connecting to other testnets and local networks is also possible**. In Metamask, simply clicking the drop down that says 'Main Network' allows you to switch networks. MetaMask also offers an option to \"buy\" test ether, which directs you to a faucet where you can request free test ether. **If the Ropsten testnet is used, ether can be obtained from the Ropsten Test Faucet Service**. You can access this faucet from this page. It requires the Metamask extension to work. https://faucet.metamask.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infura\n",
    "\n",
    "**When MetaMask connects to a test network, it uses the Infura service provider for the JSON-RPC interface**. Infura was born with the goal of delivering stable and reliable RPC access to the internal projects within ConsenSys. <br>\n",
    "**In addition to a JSON-RPC API, Infura also offers**:\n",
    "- a REST (Representational State Transfer) API, \n",
    "- IPFS (Interplanetary File System, ie. decentralized storage) API, and \n",
    "- a Websockets (ie. streaming) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infura offers gateway APIs to the Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby, and INFURAnet (a custom testnet for Infura).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Infura via MetaMask for low levels of activity, you do not need an account. **For direct use of the API, you need to register an account and use an API key provided by Infura.**\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on Infura can be found at: https://infura.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remix IDE may be used to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the mainnet and testnets including Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Kovan** (Web3 Provider using an Infura address and an API key or via Injected Web3 to use the network chosen in MetaMask) **and Ganache** (Web3 Provider Endpoint http://localhost:8545)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is nice article: [Deploy Smart Contracts on Ropsten Testnet through Ethereum Remix](https://medium.com/swlh/deploy-smart-contracts-on-ropsten-testnet-through-ethereum-remix-233cd1494b4b)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geth natively supports both the Ropsten and Rinkeby networks**. To connect to the Ropsten network use the command-line argument:<br>\n",
    "`geth --testnet`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start syncing the Ropsten blockchain. A new directory named testnet will be created in your main Ethereum data directory. A keystore directory will be created inside testnet and will store the private keys of your testnet accounts. As of writing this, the Ropsten blockchain is significantly smaller than the main Ethereum blockchain: about 14GB of data. Since the testnet requires fewer resources, it is simpler to setup and test your code on the testnet first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interacting with the testnet is similar to the mainnet**. You can start Geth testnet with a console, by running:<br>\n",
    "`geth --testnet console`\n",
    "\n",
    "**This makes it possible to perform operations such as opening a new account, checking your balance, checking the balance of other Ethereum addresses, et**c. When running outside of the Geth console, operations can be performed similarly to how they would have been performed on the mainnet, simply by adding the --testnet parameter to the command-line instruction. As an example to list all the available testnet accounts and their addresses, run:<br>\n",
    "`geth --testnet account list`\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Although much smaller, it will still take some time for the testnet to fully sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if geth has completed syncing the testnet by running the following command in the geth interactive console:<br>\n",
    "`eth.getBlock(\"latest\").number`\n",
    "\n",
    "This should return a number other than 0 once your testnet node is fully in sync. You can compare the number to the latest block in a known testnet block explorer, such as https://ropsten.etherscan.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to connect to the Rinkeby test network, use the command-line argument:<br>\n",
    "`geth --rinkeby`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Parity client supports the Ropsten and Kovan test networks**. You can select the network you want to connect to with the chain argument. For example, to sync the Ropsten test network:<br>\n",
    "`parity --chain ropsten`\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to sync the Kovan test network, use:<br>\n",
    "`parity --chain kovan`\n",

    "Olympic, Morden to Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby\n",
    "\n",
    "Olympic testnet (Network ID: 0) was the first public testnet for Frontier (referred to as Ethereum 0.9). It was launched in early 2015 and deprecated in mid 2015 when it was replaced by Morden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum’s Morden testnet (Network ID: 2) was launched with Frontier and ran from July 2015 until it was deprecated in November 2016. While anyone using Ethereum can create a testnet, Morden was the first \"official\" public testnet and replaced the Olympic testnet. Due to long sync times stemming from a bloated blockchain, and consensus issues between the Geth and Parity clients, the testnet was rebooted and reborn as Ropsten.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ropsten (Network ID: 3) is a public cross-client testnet for Homestead that was introduced in late 2016 and ran smoothly as the public testnet until the end of February 2017. According to Péter Szilágyi, a core developer for Ethereum, the end of February is when \"malicious actors decided to abuse the low PoW and gradually inflated the block gas limits to 9 billion (from the normal 4.7 million), at which point sending in gigantic transactions crippled the entire network\". Ropsten was recovered in March 2017. https://github.com/ethereum/ropsten\n",
    "\n",
    "Kovan (Network ID: 42) named after a metro station in Singapore is a public Parity testnet for Homestead that is powered by Parity’s Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm. The testnet is immune to spam attacks because the Ether supply is controlled by trusted parties. Those trusted parties are companies that are actively developing on Ethereum. While it seems like this should be a solution to Ethereum’s testnet troubles, there appear to be consensus issues within the Ethereum community regarding the Kovan testnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rinkeby (Network ID: 4) named after a metro station in Stockholm is a public Geth testnet for Homestead that was started in April 2017 by the Ethereum team and uses the PoA consensus protocol. Similarly to Kovan, because supply of Ether is controlled by trusted parties it is immune to spam attacks. Refer to EIP 225: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/225\n",

    "\n",
    "One of Ethereum’s foundational technologies is cryptography, which is a branch of mathematics used extensively in computer security. Cryptography means \"secret writing\" in Greek, but the study of cryptography encompasses more than just secret writing, which is referred to as encryption. **Cryptography can, for example, also be used to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing that secret (e.g. with a digital signature), or to prove the authenticity of data (e.g. with digital fingerprints, also known as \"hashes\"). These types of cryptographic proofs are mathematical tools critical to the operation of the Ethereum platform (and, indeed, arguable all blockchain systems), and are also extensively used in Ethereum applications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, at the time of publication, no part of the Ethereum protocol involves encryption; that is to say all communication with the Ethereum platform and between nodes (including transaction data) are unencrypted and can (necessarily) be read by anyone. This is so everyone can verify the correctness of state updates and consensus can be reached. **In the future, advanced cryptographic tools, such as \"zero knowledge proofs\" and \"homomorphic encryption\" will be available that will allow for some encrypted calculations to be recorded on the blockchain while still having consensus possible, but (while prevision has been made for them) they have yet to be deployed**. In this chapter we will introduce some of the cryptography used in Ethereum, namely \"public key cryptography\", which is used to control ownership of funds, in the form of private keys and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, **Ethereum has two different types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contracts. In this section we will examine the use of cryptography to establish ownership of ether by externally owned accounts, i.e. private keys.** Private keys enable many of the interesting properties of Ethereum, including decentralized trust and control, and ownership attestation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ownership of ether in EOAs is established through digital private keys, Ethereum addresses, and digital signatures. **The private keys are at the heart of all user interaction with Ethereum. In fact, account addresses and digital signatures are derived directly from private keys: a private key uniquely determines the single Ethereum address (which we also refer to as 'an account') which is used on-chain to identify access to funds and smart contract operations.** That access is gained using digital signatures, which are also created using the private key. \n",
    "\n",
    "**While the Ethereum specification dictates the exact form a private key must take, private keys are not used directly in the platform’s protocol in any way. That is to say that private keys should remain private and never appear in messages passed to the network nor should they be stored on-chain; it is the derived addresses and signatures that are used in the protocol**. Ethereum wallet apps often use several private keys behind-the-scenes, which arguably adds to security. They can do this easily, partly because **the generation of private keys doesn’t need any connection to, or even knowledge of, the Ethereum blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum transactions require a valid digital signature to be included in the blockchain, which, as we’ve touched on, can only be generated with a private key; therefore, anyone with a copy of that private key has control of that account and any Ether it holds. **Assuming a user keeps their private key safe, the derived digital signatures in Ethereum transactions prove the true owner of the funds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> In PKC (Public Key Cryptography) systems, such as that used by Ethereum, keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key. Think of the public key as similar to a bank account number and the private key as similar to the secret PIN; it is the later that provides control over the account, and the former that identifies it for others. **The private keys themselves are very rarely seen by the users of Ethereum; for the most part, they are stored (in encrypted form) in special files and managed by Ethereum wallet software.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the payment portion of an Ethereum transaction, the intended recipient is represented by an Ethereum address, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary account details of a bank transfer. As we will look into in more detail below, an Ethereum address for an EOA is generated from the public key portion of a PC key pair. **However, not all Ethereum addresses represent public-private key pairs; they can also represent contracts, which, as we will see later, are not backed by private keys.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this section, we will first explore basic cryptography in a bit more detail and explain the mathematics used in Ethereum. Next, we will look at how keys are generated, stored, and managed. Finally, we will review the various encoding formats used to represent private keys, public keys, and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public key cryptography and cryptocurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key cryptography (also called \"asymmetric cryptography\") is a core concept of modern day information security. First publicly invented in the 1970s by Martin Hellman, Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle, it was a monumental breakthrough which incited the first big wave of public interest into the field of cryptography. Before the 70s, strong cryptographic knowledge was held under governmental control with little public research until the open publication of public key cryptography research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key cryptography uses unique keys that are used to secure information. **These unique keys are based on mathematical functions that have a very special property: they are easy to calculate in one direction, but very difficult to calculate in the inverse direction.<br> Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures which are secured by the laws of mathematics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, multiplying two large prime numbers together is trivial. But given the product of two large primes, it is very difficult to find the prime factors (a problem called prime factorization). Let’s say I present the number 8018009 and tell you it is the product of two primes. Finding those two primes is much harder than it was for me to multiply them to produce 8018009.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some of these mathematical functions can be inverted easily if you know some secret information**.\n",
    "In our example above, if I tell you that one of the prime factors is 2003, you can trivially find the other one with a simple division: 8018009 / 2003 = 4003. Such \"one way\" functions are called trapdoor functions because they are very difficult to invert, unless you are given a piece of secret information that can be used as a shortcut to reverse the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more advanced category of mathematical functions that is useful in cryptography is based on arithmetic operations on an elliptic curve.\n",
    "> **In elliptic curve arithmetic, multiplication modulo a prime is simple but division (the inverse) is practically impossible. This is called the discrete logarithm problem and there are currently no known trapdoors. Elliptic curve cryptography is used extensively in modern computer systems and is the basis of Ethereum’s (and other cryptocurrencies') use of private keys and digital signatures.**\n",

    "In Ethereum, we use public key cryptography (also known as asymmetric cryptography) to create the public-private key pair we have been talking about in this chapter. **They are considered a \"pair\" because the public key is derived from the private key. Together, they represent an Ethereum account by providing, respectively, a publicly accessible account handle (the address) and private control over access of any ether in the account and over any authentication the account needs when using smart contracts**. The private key controls access by being the unique piece of information needed to create digital signatures, which are needed to sign transactions to spend any funds in the account. Digital signatures are also used to authenticate owners or users of contracts, as we will see in contract authentication section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital signature can be created to sign any message. \n",
    "> **For Ethereum transactions, it is the details of the transaction itself that is used as \"the message\"**. The mathematics of cryptography, and in this case, elliptic curve cryptography, provides a way for the message (i.e. the transaction details) to be combined with the private key to create a code that can only be produced with knowledge of the private key. That code is called the **digital signature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an Ethereum transaction is basically a request to access a particular account with a particular Ethereum address. **When a transaction is sent to the Ethereum network in order to move funds or interact with smart contracts, it needs to be sent with a digital signature created with the private key corresponding to the Ethereum address in question.**\n",
    "> Elliptic curve mathematics means that anyone can verify that a transaction is valid, by checking that the digital signature matches the transaction details and the Ethereum address to which access is being requested. The verification doesn’t involve the private key at all - that remains private. \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, the verification process determines beyond doubt that the transaction could have only come from someone with the private key that corresponds to the public key behind the Ethereum address**. This is the \"magic\" of public key cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In most wallet implementations, the private and public keys are stored together as a key pair for convenience. However, the public key can be trivially calculated from the private key, so storing only the private key is also possible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **no encryption** as part of the Ethereum protocol, i.e. **all messages that are sent as part of the operation of the Ethereum network can (necessarily) be read by everyone.** As such, private keys are only used to create digital signatures for transaction authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private keys\n",
    "\n",
    "A private key is simply a number, picked at random. **Ownership and control over the private key is the root of user control over all funds associated with the corresponding Ethereum address, as well as access to contracts that authorize that address.** The private key is used to create signatures that are required to spend ether by proving ownership of funds used in a transaction. The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the ether and contracts secured by that private key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss. If it’s lost, it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are lost forever too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ethereum private key is just a number. One way to pick your private keys randomly is to simply use a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256 times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you can use in an Ethereum wallet (probably - see below). The public key and address can then be generated from the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating a private key from a random number\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness. Creating an Ethereum private key is essentially the same as \"pick a number between 1 and $2^{256}$\". The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or **deterministic. Ethereum software uses the underlying operating system’s random number generator to produce 256 random bits. Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds, or press random keys on your keyboard.** An alternative could be cosmic radiation noise on the computer’s microphone channel.\n",

    "\n",
    "**If P1 and P2 are the same point, the line \"between\" P1 and P2 should extend to be the tangent on the curve at this point P1. This tangent will intersect the curve in exactly one new point. You can use techniques from calculus to determine the slope of the tangent line**. Curiously, these techniques work, even though we are restricting our interest to points on the curve with two integer coordinates!\n",
    "\n",
    "In elliptic curve math, there is also a point called the \"**point at infinity**\", which roughly corresponds to the role of the number zero in addition. On computers, it’s sometimes represented by x = y = 0 (which doesn’t satisfy the elliptic curve equation, but it’s an easy separate case that can be checked). There are a couple of special cases that explain the need for the \"point at infinity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**In some cases (e.g. if P1 and P2 have the same x values but different y values), the line will be exactly vertical, in which case P3 = \"point at infinity\".**\n",

For a point P on the elliptic curve, if k is a whole number, then k * P = P + P + P + …​ + P (k times)**. Note that k is sometimes (perhaps confusingly) called an \"exponent\" in this case.\n",

Even if you find some input data that creates a matching hash, it may not be the original input data: hash functions are \"many to one\" functions. **Finding two sets of input data that hash to the same output is called finding a \"hash collision\".

    "**The rationale behind that decision was that Ethereum addresses would eventually be hidden behind abstractions (such as name services) at higher layers of the system and that checksums should be added at higher layers if necessary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In reality, these higher layers were developed too slowly and this design choice lead to a number of problems in the early days of the ecosystem, including the loss of funds due to mistyped addresses and input validation errors.** Furthermore, because Ethereum name services were developed slower than initially expected, alternative encodings such as **ICAP** were adopted very slowly by wallet developers.\n",

    "#### Inter Exchange Client Address Protocol (ICAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Inter exchange Client Address Protocol (ICAP) is an Ethereum Address encoding that is partly compatible with the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) encoding, offering a versatile, checksummed and interoperable encoding for Ethereum Addresses**. ICAP addresses can encode Ethereum Addresses or common names registered with an Ethereum name registry.\n",

    "#### Hex encoding with checksum in capitalization (EIP-55)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due to the slow deployment of ICAP or name services, a standard was proposed with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 55 (EIP-55)**. You can read the details at: https://github.com/Ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md\n",
    "\n",
    "EIP-55 offers a backward compatible checksum for Ethereum addresses by modifying the capitalization of the hexadecimal address. **The idea is that Ethereum addresses are case-insensitive and all wallets are supposed to accept Ethereum addresses expressed in capital or lower-case characters, without any difference in interpretation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**By modifying the capitalization of the alphabetic characters in the address, we can convey a checksum that can be used to protect the integrity of the address against typing or reading mistakes**. \n",
    "- Wallets that do not support EIP-55 checksums simply ignore the fact that the address contains mixed capitalization.\n",
    "- But those that do support it, **can validate it and detect errors with a 99.986% accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixed-capitals encoding is subtle and you may not notice it at first. Our example address is:<br>\n",
    "`0x001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9`\n",

    "Can you tell the difference?<br>\n",
    "Some of the alphabetic (A-F) characters from the hexadecimal encoding alphabet are now capital, while others are lower case. You might not even have noticed the difference unless you looked carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EIP-55 is quite simple to implement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We take the Keccak-256 hash of the lower-case hexadecimal address. This hash acts as a digital fingerprint of the address, giving us a convenient checksum. \n",
    "- Any small change in the input (the address) should cause a big change in the resulting hash (the checksum), allowing us to detect errors effectively. \n",
    "- The hash of our address is then encoded in the capitalization of the address itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Let’s break it down, step-by-step:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hash the lower-case address, without the 0x prefix:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "- Capitalize each alphabetic address character if the corresponding hex digit of the hash is greater than or equal to 0x8. This is easier to show if we line up the address and the hash: <br>\n",
    "Address: `001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9`<br>\n",
    "Hash   : `23a69c1653e4ebbb619b0b2cb8a9bad49892a8b9...`<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our address contains an alphabetic character d in the fourth position. The fourth character of the hash is 6, which is less than 8. So, we leave the d lower-case. The next alphabetic character in our address is f, in the sixth position. The sixth character of the hexadecimal hash is c, which is greater than 8. Therefore, we capitalize the F in the address, and so on. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you can see, **we only use the first 20-bytes (40 hex characters) of the hash as a checksum, since we only have 20-bytes (40 hex characters) in the address to capitalize appropriately.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the resulting mixed-capitals address yourself and see if you can tell which characters were capitalized and which characters they correspond to in the address hash:<br>\n",
    "`Address: 001d3F1ef827552Ae1114027BD3ECF1f086bA0F9`<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, even though the address has only changed by one character (in fact, only one bit as \"e\" and \"f\" are 1 bit apart), the hash of the address has changed radically. That’s the property of hash functions that makes them so useful for checksums!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s line up the two and check the capitalization:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "It’s all wrong! Several of the alphabetic characters are incorrectly capitalized. Remember that the capitalization is the encoding of the correct checksum. **The capitalization of the address we input doesn’t match the checksum just calculated, meaning something has changed in the address, and an error has been introduced.**\n",

    "# Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"wallet\" is used to describe a few different things in Ethereum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At a high level, a wallet is a software application that serves as the primary user interface to Ethereum**. The wallet controls access to a user’s money, managing keys and addresses, tracking the balance, and creating and signing transactions. In addition, some Ethereum wallets can also interact with contracts, such as ERC20 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "More narrowly, from a programmer’s perspective, the word \"wallet\" refers to the system used to store and manage a user’s keys. **Every \"wallet\" has a key management component. For some wallets, that’s all there is. Other wallets are part of a much broader category, that of \"browsers\", which are interfaces to Ethereum-based decentralized applications or \"DApps\"**. There are no clear lines of distinction between the various categories that are conflated under the term \"wallet\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will look at wallets as containers for private keys, and as systems for managing these keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wallet Technology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we summarize the various technologies used to construct user-friendly, secure, and flexible Ethereum wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A common misconception about Ethereum is that Ethereum wallets contain ether or tokens. In fact, very strictly speaking, the wallet holds only keys**. The ether or other tokens are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. **Users control the tokens on the network by signing transactions with the keys in their wallets**. In a sense, an Ethereum wallet is a **keychain**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, given that the keys held by the wallet are exclusively the things that are needed to transfer ether or tokens to others, in practice this distinction is fairly irrelevant. **Where the difference does matter is in changing one’s mindset** \n",
    "\n",
    "- From: **dealing with the centralized system of conventional banking** (where only you, and the bank, can see the money in your account, and you only need convince the bank that you want to move funds to make a transaction) <br><br>\n",
    "- To: **decentralized system of blockchain platforms** (where everyone can see the ether balance of an account, although they probably don’t know the account’s owner, and everyone needs to be convinced the owner wants to move funds for a transaction to be enacted).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice this means that there is an independent way to check an account’s balance, without needing its wallet**. Moreover, you can move your account handling from your current wallet to a different wallet, if you grow to dislike the wallet app you started out using.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ethereum wallets contain keys, not ether or tokens. Wallets are like keychains containing pairs of private/public keys. Users sign transactions with the private keys, thereby proving they own the ether. **The ether is stored on the blockchain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are two primary types of wallets, distinguished by whether the keys they contain are related to each other or not**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first type is a **nondeterministic wallet**, where each key is independently generated from a different random number. The keys are not related to each other. This type of wallet is also known as a **JBOK wallet** from the phrase \"Just a Bunch Of Keys.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second type of wallet is a **deterministic wallet**, where all the keys are derived from a single master key, known as the seed. All the keys in this type of wallet are related to each other and can be generated again if one has the original seed. There are a number of different key derivation methods used in deterministic wallets. **The most commonly used derivation method uses a tree-like structure and is known as a hierarchical deterministic or HD wallet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To make deterministic wallets slightly more secure against data-loss accidents, such as having your phone stolen, or dropping it in the toilet, **the seeds are often encoded as a list of English words (or words in other languages) for you to write down and use in the event of an accident. Such a list is known as the wallet’s mnemonic code words**. Of course, if someone gets hold of your mnemonic code words, then they can also recreate your wallet and thus gain access to your ether and smart contracts. As such, be very very careful with your recovery word list! \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **Never store the mnemonic electronically, in a file, on your computer or phone. Write it down on paper and store it in a safe and secure place.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few sections introduce each of these technologies at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nondeterministic (Random) Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first Ethereum wallet (produced by the Ethereum pre-sale), each wallet file stored a single randomly generated private key. Such wallets are being replaced with deterministic wallets because these \"old style\" wallets are in many ways inferior. For example, **it is considered good practice to avoid Ethereum address re-use as part of maximizing your privacy while using Ethereum, i.e. using a new address (which needs a new private key) every time you receive funds. You can go further and use a new address after every single transaction, although this can get expensive if you deal a lot with tokens. To follow this practice a nondeterministic wallet will need to regularly increase its list of keys, which means you will need to make regular backups**. If you ever lose your data (disk failure, drink accident, phone stolen) before you’ve managed to back-up your wallet, you lose access to your funds and smart contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"type 0\"** nondeterministic wallets are the hardest to deal with because they create a new wallet file for every new address in a \"just in time\" manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, many Ethereum clients (including geth) use a keystore file, which is a JSON-encoded file that contains a single (randomly generated) private key, encrypted by a passphrase for extra security. The JSON file contents look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/KeystoreFile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The keystore format uses a Key Derivation Function (KDF) also known as a password stretching algorithm, which protects against brute-force, dictionary, or rainbow table attacks.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the private key is not encrypted by the passphrase directly. **Instead, the passphrase is stretched, by repeatedly hashing it. The hashing function is repeated for 262144 rounds, which can be seen in the keystore JSON as parameter crypto.kdfparams.n. An attacker trying to brute-force the passphrase would have to apply 262144 rounds of hashing for every attempted passphrase, which slows down the attack sufficiently as to make it infeasible for passphrases of sufficient complexity and length.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of software libraries that can read and write the keystore format, such as the JavaScript library keythereum: https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **use of nondeterministic wallets is discouraged** for anything other than simple tests. They are too cumbersome to back up and use for anything but the most basic of situations. Instead, **use an industry-standard–based HD wallet with a mnemonic seed for backup.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic, or \"seeded\" wallets are wallets that contain private keys that are all derived from a single seed. The seed is a randomly generated number that is then combined with other data, such as an index number or \"chain code\" to derive any number of private keys**. \n",
    "> In a deterministic wallet, the **seed is sufficient to recover all the derived keys, and therefore a single backup, at creation time, is sufficient to secure all the funds and smart contract access of the wallet. The seed is also sufficient for a wallet export or import**, allowing for easy migration of all the keys between different wallet implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design also makes the **the security of the seed of upmost importance**, as only the seed is needed to gain access to the entire wallet. On the other hand, being able to focus security efforts on a single piece of data can be seen as an advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HD Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic wallets were developed to make it easy to derive many keys from a single seed. Currently, the most advanced form of deterministic wallets is the hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet defined by Bitcoin’s BIP-32 standard. **HD wallets contain keys derived in a tree structure, such that a parent key can derive a sequence of child keys, each of which can derive a sequence of grandchild keys, and so on**. This tree structure is illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/hd_wallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "HD wallets offer several advantages over simpler deterministic wallets:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, **the tree structure can be used to express additional organizational meaning, such as when a specific branch of subkeys is used to receive incoming payments and a different branch is used to receive change from outgoing payments**. Branches of keys can also be used in corporate settings, allocating different branches to departments, subsidiaries, specific functions, or accounting categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second advantage of HD wallets is that **users can create a sequence of public keys without having access to the corresponding private keys. This allows HD wallets to be used on an insecure server or in a watch-only or receive-only capacity**, where the wallet doesn’t have the private keys that can spend the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to encode a private key for secure back-up and retrieval. The currently preferred method is using a sequence of words, which, when taken together in the correct order, can uniquely recreate the private key. This is sometimes known as a mnemonic and the approach has been standardized by BIP-39. **Today, many Ethereum wallets (as well as wallets for other cryptocurrencies) use this standard and can import and export seeds for backup and recovery using interoperable mnemonics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this approach has become popular, let’s have a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A seed for a deterministic wallet, in hex\n",
    "`FCCF1AB3329FD5DA3DA9577511F8F137`\n",
    "\n",
    "A seed for a deterministic wallet, from a 12-word mnemonic:\n",
    "`wolf juice proud gown wool unfair wall cliff insect more detail hub`\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practical terms, the chance of an error when writing down the hex sequence is unexceptably high. In contrast, the list of known words is quite easy to deal with, mainly because there is a high level of redundancy in the writing of words, especially English words.** If \"inzect\" had been recorded by accident, it could quickly be determined, upon the need for wallet recovery, that \"inzect\" is not a valid English word and that \"insect\" should be used instead. We are talking about writing down a representation of the seed because that is good practice when managing HD wallets: **the seed is needed to recover a wallet in the case of data loss (whether through accidents or theft) and so a backup is very prudent. However, the seed must be kept extremely safe and so digital back-ups should be vigorously avoided; hence the advice for a backup using pen and paper.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the use of a recovery word list to encode the seed for an HD wallet makes for the easiest way to safely export, transcribe, record on paper, read without error, and import a private key set into another wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wallet Best Practices\n",
    "As cryptocurrency wallet technology has matured, certain common industry standards have emerged that make bitcoin wallets broadly interoperable, easy to use, secure, and flexible. These common standards are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mnemonic code words**, based on BIP-39\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HD wallets**, based on BIP-32\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multipurpose HD wallet structure**, based on BIP-43\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multicurrency and multiaccount wallets**, based on BIP-44\n",
    "\n",
    "These standards may change or may become obsolete by future developments, but for now they form a set of interlocking technologies that have become the de facto wallet standard for bitcoin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standards have been adopted by a broad range of software and hardware bitcoin wallets, making all these wallets interoperable. A user can export a mnemonic generated on one of these wallets and import it in another wallet, recovering all transactions, keys, and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of software wallets supporting these standards include Jaxx, MetaMask, MyCrypto, and MyEtherWallet (MEW). Examples of hardware wallets supporting these standards include Keepkey, Ledger, and Trezor.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you are implementing an Ethereum wallet, it should be built as a HD wallet, with a seed encoded as mnemonic code for backup, following the BIP-32, BIP-39, BIP-43, and BIP-44 standards, as described in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mnemonic Code Words (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mnemonic code words are word sequences that represent a random number used as a seed to derive a deterministic wallet. The sequence of words is sufficient to re-create the seed and from there re-create the wallet and all the derived keys**. A wallet application that implements deterministic wallets with mnemonic words will show the user a sequence of 12 to 24 words when first creating a wallet. That sequence of words is the wallet backup and can be used to recover and re-create all the keys in the same or any compatible wallet application. Mnemonic words make it easier for users to back up wallets because they are easy to read and correctly transcribe, as compared to a random sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mnemonic words are often confused with **brainwallets**. They are not the same. The primary difference is that a brainwallet consists of words chosen by the user, whereas mnemonic words are created randomly by the wallet and presented to the user. **This important difference makes mnemonic words much more secure, because humans are very poor sources of randomness**. Perhaps more importantly, using the term \"brainwallet\" suggests that the words are to be memorized, which is a terrible idea and a recipe for not having your backup when you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mnemonic codes are defined in BIP-39. Note that BIP-39 is one implementation of a mnemonic code standard. There is a different standard, with a different set of words, used by the Electrum Bitcoin wallet and predating BIP-39. BIP-39 was proposed by the company behind the Trezor hardware wallet and is incompatible with Electrum’s implementation. However, **BIP-39 has now achieved broad industry support across dozens of interoperable implementations and should be considered the de-facto industry standard. Furthermore, BIP-39 can be used to produce multicurrency wallets supporting Ethereum, whereas Electrum seeds cannot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-39 defines the creation of a mnemonic code and seed, which we describe here in nine steps. For clarity, the process is split into two parts: steps 1 through 6 are shown in the image (Mnemonic Words) and steps 7 through 9 are shown in a later image(Mnemonic to Seed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating mnemonic words\n",
    "Mnemonic words are generated automatically by the wallet using the standardized process defined in BIP-39. The wallet starts from a source of entropy, adds a checksum, and then maps the entropy to a word list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a random sequence (entropy) of 128 to 256 bits, say from a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a checksum of the random sequence by taking the first (entropy-length/32, here 128/32) bits of its SHA256 hash.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the checksum to the end of the random sequence.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Split the result into 11-bit length segments.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Map each 11-bit value to a word from the predefined dictionary (BIP39 English Word List) of 2048 words.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The mnemonic code is the sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following depicts how entropy is used to generate mnemonic words:\n",
    "\n",

    "#### From mnemonic to seed\n",
    "The mnemonic words represent entropy with a length of 128 to 256 bits. **The entropy is then used to derive a longer (512-bit) seed through the use of the key-stretching function PBKDF2**. The seed produced is then used to build a deterministic wallet and derive its keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key-stretching function takes two parameters: the mnemonic and a salt. **The purpose of a salt in a key-stretching function is to make it difficult to build a lookup table enabling a brute-force attack**. In the BIP-39 standard, the salt has another purpose—it allows the introduction of a passphrase that serves as an additional security factor protecting the seed, as we will describe in more detail under Optional passphrase in BIP-39.\n",

    "The process described in steps 7 through 9 continues from the process described previously in Generating mnemonic words:\n",

    "7. The first parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is the mnemonic produced from step 6.<br><br>\n",
    "8. The second parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is a salt. The salt is composed of the string constant \"mnemonic\" concatenated with an optional user-supplied passphrase string.<br><br>\n",
    "9. PBKDF2 stretches the mnemonic and salt parameters using 2048 rounds of hashing with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm, producing a 512-bit value as its final output. That 512-bit value is the seed.\n",

    "![](./Images/Mnemonic2Seed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **The key-stretching function, with its 2048 rounds of hashing, is a very effective protection against brute-force attacks against the mnemonic or the passphrase**. It makes it extremely costly (in computation) to try more than a few thousand passphrase and mnemonic combinations, while the number of possible derived seeds is vast ($2^{512}$).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Optional passphrase in BIP-39\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIP-39 standard allows the use of an optional passphrase in the derivation of the seed. **If no passphrase is used, the mnemonic is stretched with a salt consisting of the constant string \"mnemonic\", producing a specific 512-bit seed from any given mnemonic**. If a passphrase is used, the stretching function produces a different seed from that same mnemonic. In fact, **given a single mnemonic, every possible passphrase leads to a different seed**. All passphrases are valid and they all lead to different seeds, forming a vast set of possible uninitialized wallets. **The set of possible wallets is so large ($2^{512}$) that there is no practical possibility of brute-forcing or accidentally guessing one that is in use.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are no \"wrong\" passphrases in BIP-39. Every passphrase leads to some wallet, which unless previously used will be empty. <br>**Each wallet is characterized by its seed, therefore as different passphrases, when undergo key-stretching function as salts alongside mnemonics, results in different seeds and therefore, we say, different wallets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional passphrase creates two important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A second factor (something memorized) that makes a mnemonic useless on its own, protecting mnemonic backups from compromise by a thief.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A form of plausible deniability or **duress wallet**, where a chosen passphrase leads to a wallet with a small amount of funds used to distract an attacker from the \"real\" wallet that contains the majority of funds, that is, different passphrase as salt with the mnemonic in the key-stretching function would result in different seed which would lead to different private keys which can take charge of different amount of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the use of a passphrase also introduces the risk of loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the wallet owner is incapacitated or dead and no one else knows the passphrase, the seed is useless and all the funds stored in the wallet are lost forever.\n",
    "- Conversely, if the owner backs up the passphrase in the same place as the seed, it defeats the purpose of a second factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**While passphrases are very useful, they should only be used in combination with a carefully planned process for backup and recovery, considering the possibility of surviving the owner and allowing his or her family to recover the cryptocurrency estate.**\n",

    "### Creating an HD Wallet from the Seed\n",
    "\n",
    "HD wallets are created from a single root seed, which is a 128-, 256-, or 512-bit random number. Most commonly, this seed is generated from a mnemonic as detailed in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every key in the HD wallet is deterministically derived from this root seed, which makes it possible to re-create the entire HD wallet from that seed in any compatible HD wallet**. This makes it easy to export, back up, restore, and import HD wallets containing thousands or even millions of keys by simply transferring only the mnemonic that the root seed is derived from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most HD wallets follow the BIP-32 standard, which has become a de-facto industry standard for deterministic key generation. You can read the detailed specification in: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We won’t be discussing the details of BIP-32 here, only the components necessary to understand how it is used in wallets. \n",
    "> **For in depth look read (recommended) the following section from Mastering Bitcoin**: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/parsh24/Blockchain/blob/master/Mastering%20Bitcoin/Mastering%20Bitcoin.ipynb#Creating-an-HD-Wallet-from-the-Seed\n",
    "\n",
    "The main important aspect is the tree-like hierarchical relationships that is possible for the derived keys to have, as you can see below. We will also need to understand the idea of extended keys and hardened keys, which are explained in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HD-Wallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are dozens of interoperable implementations of BIP-32 offered in many software libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Consensys/eth-lightwallet](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth-lightwallet)<br> Lightweight JS Ethereum Wallet for nodes and browser (with BIP-32)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a **BIP-32 standalone web page generator** that is very useful for testing and experimentation with BIP-32: http://bip32.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The standalone BIP-32 generator is not an HTTPS site. That’s to remind you that the use of this tool is not secure. It is only for testing. You should not use the keys produced by this site in with real funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended public and private keys\n",
    "\n",
    "In BIP-32 terminology, **keys can be \"extended\" so that they can produce \"children\". In this way, keys become extended keys.** With the right mathematical operations, extended \"parent\" keys can be used to derive \"child\" keys and thus produce the tree hierarchy of keys and addresses we have been talking about earlier in this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A parent key doesn’t have to be at the top of the tree. They can be picked out from anywhere in the tree hierarchy. \"Extending\" a key involves taking the key itself and appending a special \"chain code\" to it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the key is a private key, it is an extended private key distinguished by the prefix **xprv**:<br>\n",
    "`xprv9s21ZrQH143K2JF8RafpqtKiTbsbaxEeUaMnNHsm5o6wCW3z8ySyH4UxFVSfZ8n7ESu7fgir8imbZKLYVBxFPND1pniTZ81vKfd45EHKX73`\n",
    "\n",
    "An extended public key is distinguished by the prefix **xpub**:<br>\n",
    "`xpub661MyMwAqRbcEnKbXcCqD2GT1di5zQxVqoHPAgHNe8dv5JP8gWmDproS6kFHJnLZd23tWevhdn4urGJ6b264DfTGKr8zjmYDjyDTi9U7iyT`\n",
    "\n",
    "A very useful characteristic of HD wallets is the ability to derive child public keys from parent public keys, without having the private keys. **This gives us two ways to derive a child public key**:\n",
    "- either directly from the child private key, \n",
    "- or from the parent public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extended public key can be used, therefore, to derive all of the public keys (and only the public keys) in that branch of the HD wallet structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This shortcut can be used to create very secure public key–only deployments where a server or application has a copy of an extended public key and no private keys whatsoever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public keys and Ethereum addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those addresses. Meanwhile, on another, more secure server, the extended private key can derive all the corresponding private keys to sign transactions and spend the money.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**One common application of this solution is to install an extended public key on a web server that serves an e-commerce application.** The web server can use the public key derivation function to create a new Ethereum address for every transaction (e.g., for a customer shopping cart). The web server will not have any private keys that would be vulnerable to theft. Without HD wallets, the only way to do this is to generate thousands of Ethereum addresses on a separate secure server and then preload them on the e-commerce server. That approach is cumbersome and requires constant maintenance to ensure that the e-commerce server doesn’t \"run out\" of keys. Hence the preference to use extended public keys from HD wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another common application of this solution is for cold-storage or hardware wallets**. In that scenario, the extended private key can be stored on a hardware wallet, while the extended public key can be kept online. The user can create \"receive\" addresses at will, while the private keys are safely stored offline. To spend the funds, the user can use the extended private key on an offline signing Ethereum client or sign transactions on the hardware wallet device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardened child key derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to derive a branch of public keys from an xpub (extended public key) is very useful, but it comes with a potential risk. Access to an xpub does not give access to child private keys. However, **because the xpub contains the chain code (used to derive child public keys from the parent public key), if a child private key is known, or somehow leaked, it can be used with the chain code to derive all the other child private keys. A single leaked child private key, together with a parent chain code, reveals all the private keys of all the children. Worse, the child private key together with a parent chain code can be used to deduce the parent private key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter this risk, HD wallets use an alternative derivation function called hardened derivation, which \"breaks\" the relationship between parent public key and child chain code. **The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a \"firewall\" in the parent/child sequence, with a chain code that cannot be used to compromise a parent or sibling private key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, if you want to use the convenience of an xpub to derive branches of public keys, without exposing yourself to the risk of a leaked chain code, you should derive it from a hardened parent, rather than a normal parent. **Best practice is to have the level-1 children of the master keys always derived through the hardened derivation, to prevent compromise of the master keys.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index numbers for normal and hardened derivation\n",
    "The index number used in the derivation function is a 32-bit integer. To easily distinguish between keys derived through the normal derivation function versus keys derived through hardened derivation, this index number is split into two ranges. **Index numbers between 0 and $2^{31}$ – 1 (0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF) are used only for normal derivation. Index numbers between $2^{31}$ and $2^{32}$ - 1 (0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF) are used only for hardened derivation**. Therefore, if the index number is less than $2^{31}$, the child is normal, whereas if the index number is equal or above $2^{31}$, the child is hardened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make the index number easier to read and display, the index number for hardened children is displayed starting from zero, but with a prime symbol**. The first normal child key is therefore displayed as 0, whereas the first hardened child (index 0x80000000) is displayed as 0&#x27;. In sequence then, the second hardened key would have index 0x80000001 and would be displayed as 1&#x27;, and so on. When you see an HD wallet index i&#x27;, that means $2^{31}$+i.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HD wallet key identifier (path)\n",
    "Keys in an HD wallet are identified using a \"path\" naming convention, with each level of the tree separated by a slash (/) character (see HD wallet path examples). Private keys derived from the master private key start with \"m.\" Public keys derived from the master public key start with \"M.\" Therefore, the first child private key of the master private key is m/0. The first child public key is M/0. The second grandchild of the first child is m/0/1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**The \"ancestry\" of a key is read from right to left, until you reach the master key from which it was derived**.<br>\n",
    "For example, identifier m/x/y/z describes the key that is the z-th child of key m/x/y, which is the y-th child of key m/x, which is the x-th child of m.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HDWalletPathEx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating the HD wallet tree structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The HD wallet tree structure offers tremendous flexibility. Each parent extended key can have 4 billion children: 2 billion normal children and 2 billion hardened children. Each of those children can have another 4 billion children, and so on. The tree can be as deep as you want, with an infinite number of generations. With all that flexibility, however, it becomes quite difficult to navigate this infinite tree. **It is especially difficult to transfer HD wallets between implementations, because the possibilities for internal organization into branches and subbranches are endless.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two BIPs, BIP-43 and BIP-44, offer a solution to this complexity by creating some proposed standards for the structure of HD wallet trees**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-43 proposes the use of the first hardened child index as a special identifier that signifies the \"purpose\" of the tree structure**. Based on BIP-43, an HD wallet should use only one level-1 branch of the tree, with the index number identifying the structure and namespace of the rest of the tree by defining its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an HD wallet using only branch m/i&#x27;/ is intended to signify a specific purpose and that purpose is identified by index number \"i\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extending that specification, BIP-44 proposes a multi-account structure as \"purpose\" number 44' under BIP-43**. All HD wallets following the BIP-44 structure are identified by the fact that they only used one branch of the tree: m/44'/.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-44 specifies the structure as consisting of five predefined tree levels:<br>\n",
    "`m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **first-level \"purpose\"** is always set to 44' signifying **multi-currency/multi-account structure**. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **second-level \"coin_type\" specifies the type of cryptocurrency coin**, allowing for multicurrency HD wallets where each currency has its own subtree under the second level. There are three currencies defined for now: Bitcoin is m/44'/0', Bitcoin Testnet is m/44&#x27;/1&#x27;, and Litecoin is m/44&#x27;/2&#x27;. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **third level of the tree is \"account,\" which allows users to subdivide their wallets into separate logical subaccounts**, for accounting or organizational purposes. For example, an HD wallet might contain two bitcoin \"accounts\": m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27; and m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/1&#x27;. Each account is the root of its own subtree. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the **fourth level, \"change,\" an HD wallet has two subtrees, one for creating receiving addresses and one for creating change addresses**. Note that whereas the previous levels used hardened derivation, this level uses normal derivation. This is to allow this level of the tree to export extended public keys for use in a nonsecured environment.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- Usable addresses are derived by the HD wallet as children of the fourth level, making the **fifth level of the tree the \"address_index\"**. This is the level from where we start generating keys in order to derive addresses. For example, the third receiving address for bitcoin payments in the primary account would be M/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27;/0/2. \n",

    "# Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions are signed messages originated by an externally owned account, transmitted by the Ethereum network, and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.** Behind that basic definition, there are a lot of surprising and fascinating details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another way to look at transactions is that they are the only thing that can trigger a change of state or cause a contract to execute in the EVM. Ethereum is a global singleton state machine, and transactions are the only thing that can make that state machine \"tick\", changing its state.** Contracts don’t run on their own. Ethereum doesn’t run \"in the background\". **Everything starts with a transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will dissect transactions, show how they work, and understand the details. Note that much of this chapter is addressed to those who are interested in managing their own transactions at a low level, e.g. because they are writing a wallet app; you don’t have to worry about this if you are happy using existing wallet applications, although you may find the details interesting, of course!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "First let’s take a look at the basic structure of a transaction, as it is serialized and transmitted on the Ethereum network. **Each client and application that receives a serialized transaction will store it in-memory using its own internal data structure, perhaps embellished with metadata that doesn’t exist in the network serialized transaction itself. The network serialization of a transaction is, therefore, the only common standard of a transaction’s structure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction is a serialized binary message that contains the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **nonce**<br>\n",
    "A sequence number, issued by the originating EOA, used to prevent message replay.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gas price**<br>\n",
    "The price of gas (in wei) the originator is willing to pay.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gas limit**<br>\n",
    "The maximum amount of gas the originator is willing to buy for this transaction.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **to**<br>\n",
    "Destination Ethereum address.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **value**<br>\n",
    "Amount of ether to send to the destination.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **data**<br>\n",
    "Variable length binary data payload.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **v,r,s**<br>\n",
    "The three components of an ECDSA digital signature of the originating EOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The transaction message’s structure is serialized using the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding scheme, which was created specifically for accurate and byte-perfect data serialization in Ethereum**. All numbers in Ethereum are encoded as big-endian integers, of lengths that are multiples of 8 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that the field labels (\"to\", \"gas limit\", etc.) are shown here for clarity, but are not part of the transaction serialized data, which contains the field values RLP-encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, RLP does not contain any field delimiters or labels. **RLP’s length prefix is used to identify the length of each field. Anything beyond the defined length, therefore, belongs to the next field in the structure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is the actual transaction structure transmitted, **most internal representations and user interface visualizations embellish this with additional information**, derived from the transaction or from the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may notice there is **no \"from\" data in the address identifying the originator EOA**. <br>\n",
    "That is because the **EOA’s public key can be derived from the v,r,s components of the ECDSA signature. The address can, in turn, be derived from the public key.** When you see a transaction showing a \"from\" field, that was added by the software used to visualize the transaction. **Other metadata frequently added to the transaction by client software include the block number (once it is mined and included in the blockchain) and a transaction ID (calculated hash**). Again, this data is derived from the transaction and not part of the transaction message itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The transaction nonce\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonce is one of the most important and least understood components of a transaction. The definition in the Yellow Paper reads:<br>\n",
    "**\"nonce: A scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent from this address or, in the case of accounts with associated code, the number of contract-creations made by this account.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, **the nonce is an attribute of the originating address, i.e. it only has meaning in the context of the sending address**. However, the nonce is not stored explicitly as part of an account’s state on the blockchain. Instead **it is calculated dynamically, by counting the number of confirmed transactions that have originated from an address**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two scenarios where the existence of a transaction counting nonce is important: \n",
    "- the usability feature of **transactions being included in the order they are created**; and \n",
    "- the vital feature of **transaction duplication protection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example scenario for each of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imagine you wish to make two transactions. You have an important payment to make of 6 ether, and also another payment of 8 ether. You sign and broadcast the 6 ether transaction first, because it is the more important one, and then you sign and broadcast the second, 8 ether transaction. Sadly, you have overlooked the fact that this account of yours has only 10 ether, so the network can’t accept both transactions. One of them will fail. Because you sent the more important 6 ether one first, you understandably expect that one to go through and the 8 ether one to be rejected. However, in a decentralized system like Ethereum, nodes may receive the transactions in either order; there is no guarantee that a particular node will have one transaction propagated to it before the other. As such, it will almost certainly be the case that some nodes receive the 6 ether transaction first and others receive the 8 ether transaction first. **Without the nonce, it would be random as to which one gets accepted and which rejected. However, with the nonce included, the first transaction you sent will have the correct nonce, let’s say it is 3, signifying that it is next in line to be processed. The 8 ether transaction has the next nonce value, i.e. 4, and so will be ignored until your account shows up to have officially processed all the transactions with nonces from 0 to 3, even if the 8 ether transaction is received first. Phew!**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now imagine you have an account with 100 ether. Fantastic! You find someone on-line who will accept payment in ether for a mcguffin-widget that you really want to buy. You send them 2 ether and they send you the mcguffin-widget. Lovely. To make that 2 ether payment, you signed a transaction sending 2 ether from your account to their account, and then broadcast it to the Ethereum network to be verified and included on the blockchain. **Now, without a nonce value in the transaction, a second transaction sending 2 ether to the same address a second time will look exactly the same as the first transaction. This would mean that anyone who saw your transaction on the Ethereum network (which means everyone, including the recipient, or your enemies) can \"replay\" the transaction again and again and again until all your ether is gone simply by copy-and-pasting your original transaction and resending it to the network. However, with the nonce value included in the transaction data, every single transaction is unique, even when sending the same amount of ether to the send recipient address multiple times**. This means that, by having the incrementing nonce as part of the transaction, it is simply no possible for anyone to \"duplicate\" a payment you have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, <u>it is important to note that the use of the nonce is actually vital for an account based protocol</u>, in contrast to the \"UTXO\" mechanism of the bitcoin protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keeping track of nonces\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, the nonce is an up-to-date count of the number of confirmed (i.e. on-chain) transactions that have originated from an account. To find out what the nonce is, you can interrogate the blockchain, for example via the web3 interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving the transaction count of our example address<br>\n",
    "`web3.eth.getTransactionCount(\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\")`<br>\n",
    "`40`\n",
    "\n",
    "> The nonce is a zero-based counter, meaning the first transaction has nonce 0. In above example address, we have a transaction count of 40, meaning nonces 0 through 39 have been seen. The next transaction’s nonce will need to be 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your wallet will keep track of nonces for each address it manages. It’s fairly simple to do that, as long as you are only originating transactions from a single point. Let’s say you are writing your own wallet software or some other application that originates transactions. **How do you track nonces?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you create a new transaction, you assign the next nonce in the sequence. But until it is confirmed, it will not count towards the `getTransactionCount` total.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Be careful when using the getTransactionCount function for counting pending transactions, because you might run into some problems if you send a few transactions in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Multi-getTransacEx.png)\n",

    "#### Gaps in nonces, duplicate nonces, and confirmation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep track of nonces if you are creating transactions programmatically, especially if you are doing so from multiple independent processes simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Ethereum network processes transactions sequentially, based on the nonce. That means that if you transmit a transaction with nonce 0 and then transmit a transaction with nonce 2, the second transaction will not be included in any blocks. It will be stored in the mempool, while the Ethereum network waits for the missing nonce to appear**. All nodes will assume that the missing nonce has simply been delayed and that the transaction with nonce 2 was received out-of-sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you then transmit a transaction with the missing nonce 1, both transactions (nonces 1 and 2) will be processed and included (if valid, of course). **Once you fill the gap, the network can mine the out-of-sequence transaction that it held in the mempool.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means is that if you create several transactions in sequence and one of them does not get officially included in any blocks, all the subsequent transactions will be \"stuck\", waiting for the missing nonce**. A transaction can create an inadvertent **\"gap\"** in the nonce sequence because it is invalid or has insufficient gas. To get things moving again, you have to transmit a valid transaction with the missing nonce. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You should be equally mindful that once a tx with the \"missing\" nonce is validated by the network, all the broadcast transactions with subsequent nonces will incrementally become valid; **it is not possible to \"recall\" a transaction!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If on the other hand you accidentally duplicate a nonce**, for example by transmitting two transactions with the same nonce, but different recipients or values, then one of them will be confirmed and one will be rejected. **Which one is confirmed will be determined by the sequence in which they arrive at the first validating node that receives them, i.e. it will be fairly random.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, keeping track of nonces is necessary and if your application doesn’t manage that process correctly, you will run into problems. Unfortunately, things get even more difficult if you are trying to do this concurrently, as we will see in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concurrency, transaction origination, and nonces\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency is a complex aspect of computer science, and it crops up unexpectedly sometimes, especially in decentralized and distributed real-time systems like Ethereum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple terms, concurrency is when you have simultaneous computation by multiple independent systems. These can be in the same program (e.g. threading), on the same CPU (e.g. multi-processing), or on different computers (i.e. distributed systems). Ethereum, by definition, is a system that allows concurrency of operations (nodes, clients, DApps), but enforces a singleton state through consensus.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine that we have multiple independent wallet applications that are generating transactions from the same address or addresses. One example of such a situation would be an exchange processing withdrawals from the exchange’s hot wallet. Ideally, you’d want to have more than one computer processing withdrawals, so that it doesn’t become a bottleneck or single point of failure. However, this quickly becomes problematic, **as having more than one computer producing withdrawals will result in some thorny concurrency problems, not least of which is the selection of nonces**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How do multiple computers generating, signing and broadcasting transactions from the same hot wallet account coordinate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You could use a single computer to assign nonces, on a first-come first-served basis to computers signing transactions.** However, this computer is now a single point of failure. Worse, if several nonces are assigned and one of them never gets used (because of a failure in the computer processing the transaction with that nonce), all of the subsequent ones get stuck.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Another approach would be to generate the transactions, but not assign a nonce to them** (and therefore leave them unsigned - remember that the nonce is an integral part of the transaction data and therefore needs to be included in the digital signature that authenticates the transaction). **Then queue them to a single node that signs them and also keeps track of nonces**. Again, this would be a pitch-point in the process: **the signing and tracking of nonces is the part of your operation that is likely to become congested under load, whereas the generation of the unsigned transaction is the part you don’t really need to parallelize.** You would have some concurrency, but you don’t have it in any useful part of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the end, these concurrency problems, on top of the difficulty of tracking account balances and transaction confirmations in independent processes, force most implementations towards avoiding concurrency and creating bottlenecks** such as a single process handling all withdrawal transactions in an exchange, or setting up multiple hot wallets that can work completely independently for withdrawals and only need to be intermittently re-balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction gas\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss gas in detail in later. However, let’s cover some basics about the role of the gasPrice and gasLimit components of a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas is the fuel of Ethereum. Gas is not ether - it’s a separate virtual currency with its own exchange rate against ether. Ethereum uses gas to control the amount of resources that a transaction can use, since it will be processed on thousands of computers around the world**. The open-ended (Turing complete) computation model requires some form of metering in order to avoid denial of service attacks or inadvertent resource-devouring transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas is separate from ether in order to protect the system from the volatility that might arise along with rapid changes in the value of ether, and also as a way to manage the important and sensitive ratios between the costs of the various resources that gas pays for (namely, computation, memory and storage).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas Price**<br>\n",
    "The `gasPrice` field in a transaction **allows the transaction originator to set the exchange rate of each unit of gas that they are willing to pay**. Gas price is measured in wei per gas unit. For example, in a transaction we recently created, our wallet had set the gasPrice to 3 Gwei (3 Giga-wei or 3 billion wei).\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular site **ethgasstation.info** provides information on the current prices of gas, and other relevant gas metrics for the Ethereum main network: https://ethgasstation.info/\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallets can adjust the gasPrice in transactions they originate, to achieve faster confirmation of transactions. **The higher the gasPrice, the faster the transaction is likely to confirm. Conversely, lower priority transactions can carry a reduced price, resulting in slower confirmation**. The minimum value that gasPrice that can be set to is zero, which means a fee-free transaction. During periods of low demand for space in a block, such transactions might very well get mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The minimum acceptable gasPrice is zero. That means that wallets can generate completely free transactions**. Depending on capacity, these may never be confirmed, but there is nothing in the protocol that prohibits free transactions. You can find several examples of such transactions successfully included on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web3 interface offers a gasPrice suggestion, by calculating a median price across several blocks:<br>\n",
    "`truffle(mainnet)> web3.eth.getGasPrice(console.log)`<br>\n",
    "`truffle(mainnet)> null BigNumber { s: 1, e: 10, c: [ 10000000000 ] }`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas Limit**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important field related to gas, is `gasLimit`. **In simple terms, gasLimit defines how the maximum number of units of gas the transaction originator is willing to buy in order to complete the transaction**. For simple payments, meaning transactions that transfer ether from one EOA to another EOA, the gas amount needed is fixed at **21,000 gas units**. To calculate how much ether that will cost, you multiply 21,000 with the gasPrice you’re willing to pay:\n",
    "\n",
    "`truffle(mainnet)> web3.eth.getGasPrice(function(err, res) {console.log(res*21000)} )`<br>\n",
    "`truffle(mainnet)> 210000000000000`\n",
    "\n",
    "**If your transaction’s destination address is a contract, then the amount of gas needed can be estimated but cannot be determined with accuracy. That’s because a contract can evaluate different conditions that lead to different execution paths, with different total gas costs**. That means that the contract may execute only a simple computation or a more complex one depending on conditions that are outside of your control and cannot be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this let’s look at an example: <br>\n",
    "We can write a smart contract that increments a counter each time it is called and executes a particular loop a number of times equal to the call count. Maybe on the 100th call it gives out a special price that needs extra calculations. If you call the contract 99 times one thing happens, but on the 100th something very different happens. The amount of gas you would pay for that depends on how many other transactions have called that function before your transaction is included in a block. Perhaps your estimate is based on being the 99th transaction and just before your transaction is confirmed, someone else calls the contract for the 99th time. Now you’re the 100th transaction to call and the computation effort (and gas cost) is much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "To borrow a common analogy used in Ethereum, you can think of gasLimit as the fuel tank in your car (your car is the transaction). You fill the tank with as much gas as you think it will need for the journey (the computation needed to validate your transaction). You can estimate the amount to some degree, but there might be unexpected changes to your journey such as a diversion (a more complex execution path), which increase fuel consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analogy to a fuel tank is somewhat misleading, however. It’s actually more like a credit account for a gas station company, where you pay after the trip is completed, based on how much gas you actually used. **When you transmit your transaction, one of the first validation steps is to check that the account it originated from has enough ether to pay the gasPrice * gas fee. But the amount is not actually deducted from your account until the end of the transaction execution. You are only billed for gas actually consumed by your transaction at the end, but you have to have enough balance for the maximum amount you are willing to pay before you send your transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction recipient\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipient of a transaction is specified in the to field. **This contains a 20-byte Ethereum address. The address can be an EOA or a contract address.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum does no further validation of this field. Any 20-byte value is considered valid. **If the 20-byte value corresponds to an address without a corresponding private key, or without a corresponding contract, the transaction is still valid**. Ethereum has no way of knowing whether an address was correctly derived from a public key (and therefore from a private key) in existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning:\n",
    "> **The Ethereum protocol does not validate recipient addresses in transactions. You can send to an address that has no corresponding private key or contract, thereby \"burning\" the ether, rendering it forever unspendable.** Validation should be done at the user interface level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending a transaction to the wrong address will probably burn the ether sent, rendering it forever inaccessible (unspendable), since most addresses do not have a known private key and therefore no signature can be generated to spend it. **It is assumed that validation of the address happens at the user interface level (see EIP-55 or ICAP)**. In fact, there are a number of valid reasons for burning ether, including as a game-theory disincentive to cheating in payment channels and other smart contracts, and, **since the amount of ether is finite, burning ether effectively distributes the value burned to all ether holders (in proportion to the amount of ether they hold).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction value and data\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main \"payload\" of a transaction is contained in two fields: value and data.**<br>\n",
    "Transactions can have: \n",
    "- both value and data; \n",
    "- only value; \n",

    "\n",
    "- **For EOA addresses, or rather for any address that isn’t flagged as a contract on the blockchain, Ethereum will record a state change, adding the value you sent to the balance of the address**.

    "\n",
    "**A contract can reject incoming payments by throwing an exception** immediately when a function is called, or as determined by conditions coded in a function. **If the function terminated successfully (without an exception), then the contract’s state is updated to reflect an increase in the contract’s ether balance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transmitting a data payload to an EOA or contract\n",
    "\n",
    "When your transaction contains a data payload, it is most likely addressed to a contract address. That doesn’t mean you cannot send a data payload to an EOA - that is completely valid in the Ethereum protocol. **However, in that case, the interpretation of the data payload is up to the wallet you use to access the EOA. It is totally ignored by the Ethereum protocol. Most wallets also ignore any data payload received in a transaction to an EOA they control. In the future, it is possible that standards may emerge that allow wallets to interpret data payload encodings the way contracts do**, thereby allowing transactions to invoke functions running inside user wallets. **The critical difference is that any interpretation of the data payload by an EOA is not subject to Ethereum’s consensus rules, unlike a contract execution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, **let’s assume your transaction is delivering a data payload to a contract address. In that case, the data payload will be interpreted by the EVM as contract invocation.

    "\n",
    "### Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital signature algorithm used in Ethereum is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA. ECDSA is the algorithm used for digital signatures based on elliptic curve private/public key pairs, as described in earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **digital signature serves three purposes in Ethereum** (see the following sidebar):\n",
    "- First, the signature **proves that the owner of the private key, who is by implication the owner of an Ethereum account, has authorized the spending of ether, or execution of a contract.** <br><br>\n",
    "- Secondly, **the proof of authorization is undeniable (non-repudiation)**. <br><br>\n",
    "- Thirdly, the signature **proves that the transaction data have not and cannot be modified by anyone after the transaction has been signed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia’s Definition of a \"Digital Signature\":\n",
    "> A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or documents. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (non-repudiation), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Digital Signatures Work\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital signature is a mathematical scheme that consists of two parts. \n",
    "- The first part is an **algorithm for creating a signature, using a private key (the signing key) from a message** (which in our case is the transaction). \n",
    "- The second part is an **algorithm that allows anyone to verify the signature by only using the message and a public key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a digital signature\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ethereum’s implementation of ECDSA, **the \"message\" being signed is the transaction, or more accurately, the Keccak256 hash of the RLP-encoded data from the transaction. The signing key is the EOA’s private key**. The result is the signature:<br>\n",
    "$Sig=F_{sig}(F_{keccha256}(m),k)$\n",

    "\n",
    "The function Fsig produces a signature Sig that is composed of two values, commonly referred to as R and S: `Sig = (R, S)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verifying the Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "**To verify the signature, one must have the signature (R and S), the serialized transaction, and the public key** (that corresponds to the private key used to create the signature). Essentially, verification of a signature means \"Only the owner of the private key that generated this public key could have produced this signature on this transaction\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**The signature verification algorithm takes the message (i.e. a hash of the transaction for our usage), the signer’s public key and the signature (R and S values), and returns TRUE if the signature is valid for this message and public key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ECDSA Math\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, signatures are created by a mathematical function F_{sig} that produces a signature composed of two values R and S. In this section we look at the function F_{sig} in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signature algorithm first generates an ephemeral (temporary) private key in a cryptographically secure way. **This temporary key is used in the calculation of the R and S values to ensure that the sender’s actual private key can’t be calculated by attackers watching signed transactions on the Ethereum network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we known from, the ephemeral private key is used to derive the corresponding (ephemeral) public key, so we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A cryptographically secure random number q, which is used as the ephemeral private key, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the corresponding ephemeral public key Q, generated from q and the elliptic curve generator point G (that is, $Q = q*G$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **R value of the digital signature is then the x coordinate of the ephemeral public key Q.**\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, the algorithm calculates the S value of the signature, such that:<br>\n",
    "$S ≡ q^{-1} (Keccak256(m) + R * k)(mod p)$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Transaction signing in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce a valid transaction, the originator must apply a digital signature to the message, using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature algorithm. **When we say \"sign the transaction\", we actually mean \"sign the Keccak256 hash of the RLP serialized transaction data\". The signature is applied to the hash of the transaction data, not the transaction itself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To sign a transaction in Ethereum, the originator must:**\n",
    "- **Create a transaction data structure**, containing nine fields: nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, chainID, 0, 0<br><br>\n",

    "- **Compute the Keccak256 hash** of this serialized message<br><br>\n",

    "- **Append the ECDSA signature’s computed v, r and s values** in the transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**The special signature variable v indicates two things: the chain ID and the recovery identifier to help the ECDSA recover function check the signature**. It is calculated as either one of 27 or 28, or as the chain ID doubled plus 35 or 36. For more information on the chain ID, see Raw transaction creation with EIP-155. The recovery identifier (27 or 28 in the \"old style\" signatures, or 35 or 36 in the full \"Spurious Dragon\" style transactions) is used to indicate the parity of the y component of the public key (see The signature prefix value (v) and public key recovery for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **At block # 2,675,000, Ethereum implemented the \"Spurious Dragon\" hard fork that, among other changes, introduced a new signing scheme that includes transaction replay protection** (preventing transactions meant for one network being replayed on others). This new signing scheme is specified in **EIP-155**. **This change affects the form of the transaction and its signature, so attention must be paid to the first of the three signature variables (i.e. v) which takes one of two forms and indicates the data fields included in the transaction message being hashed.**\n",

This ensures that transactions created for one blockchain** (e.g. Ethereum main network) **are invalid on another blockchain** (e.g. Ethereum Classic or Ropsten test network). Therefore, <u>transactions broadcast on one network cannot be replayed on another, hence the \"replay attack protection\" name of the standard</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EIP-155 adds three fields to the main six fields of the transaction data structure, namely the chain identifier, 0, and 0. These three fields are added to the transaction data before it is encoded and hashed. The three additional fields therefore change the transaction’s hash, to which the signature is later applied**. By including the chain identifier in the data being signed, the transaction signature prevents any changes, as the signature is invalidated if the chain identifier is modified. Therefore, **EIP-155 makes it impossible for a transaction to be replayed on another chain, because the signature’s validity depends on the chain identifier.**\n",

    "\n",
    "### The signature prefix value (v) and public key recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in Structure of Transaction, the transaction message doesn’t include any \"from\" field.

    "\n",

    "- z are the n-lowest bits of the message hash\n",
    "- G is the elliptic curve generator point\n",

    "To make things more efficient, **the transaction signature includes a prefix value v, which tells us which of the two possible R values are the ephemeral public key.

    "\n",
    "## Separating signing and transmission (offline signing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a transaction is signed, it is ready to transmit to the Ethereum network. **The three steps of creating, signing, and broadcasting a transaction normally happen as a single operation, for example using web3.eth.sendTransaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, as we saw in Raw transaction creation and signing, you can create and sign the transaction in two separate steps.** Once you have a signed transaction, you can then transmit it using `web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction` which takes a hex-encoded and signed transaction and transmits it on the Ethereum network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why would you want to separate the signing and transmission of transactions?**<br>\n",
    "The most common reason is **security: the computer that signs a transaction must have unlocked private keys loaded in memory. The computer that does the transmiting must be connected to the internet (and be running an Ethereum client). If these two functions are on one computer, then you have private keys on an online system, which is quite dangerous**. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Separating the functions of signing and transmitting and performing them on different machines (on an offline and online device, respectively) is called **offline signing** and is a common security practice. The full procedure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creation**: can be using an online or offline device, but online is easier because the current state of the account to be used can be checked, notably the current nonce and funds available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Signing**: transfer the constructed transaction to an \"air-gapped\" offline device for transaction signing, e.g. via QR code scanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transmission**: transfer the signed transaction (back) to an online device for broadcasting on the Ethereum client, e.g. via QR scanning or USB memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depending on the level of security you need, your \"offline signing\" computer can have varying degrees of separation from the online computer, ranging from an isolated and firewalled subnet (online but segregated) to a completely offline system known as an air-gapped system**. In an air-gapped system there is no network connectivity at all - the computer is separated from the online environment by a gap of \"air\". **To sign transactions you transfer them to and from the air-gapped computer using data storage media or (better) a webcam and QR code**. Of course, this means you must manually transfer every transaction you want signed, and this doesn’t scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not many environments can utilize a fully air-gapped system, even a small degree of isolation has significant security benefits. For example, an isolated subnet with a firewall that only allows a message-queue protocol through, can offer a much-reduced attack surface and much higher security than signing on the online system. **Many companies use a protocol such as ZeroMQ (0MQ), as it offers a reduced attack surface for the signing computer**. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a setup like that, transactions are serialized and queued for signing:\n",
    "- The queuing protocol transmits the serialized message, in a way similar to a TCP socket, to the signing computer. \n",
    "- The signing computer reads the serialized transactions from the queue (carefully), applies a signature with the appropriate key, and places them on an outgoing queue. \n",
    "- The outgoing queue transmits the signed transactions to a computer with an Ethereum client that de-queues them and transmits them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Ethereum network uses a \"flood\" routing protocol. Each Ethereum client, acts as a node in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, which (ideally) forms a mesh network. No network node is \"special\": they all act as equal peers**. We will use the term \"node\" to refer to an Ethereum client that is connected to and participates in the P2P network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction propagation starts with:\n",
    "- The originating Ethereum node creating (or receiving from offline) a signed transaction. <br><br>\n",
    "- The transaction is validated and then transmitted to all the other Ethereum nodes that are directly connected to the originating node. On average, each Ethereum node maintains connections to at least 13 other nodes, called its neighbors.<br><br>\n",
    "- Each neighbor node validates the transaction as soon as they receive it. If they agree that it is valid, they store a copy and propagate it to all their neighbors (except the one it came from). <br><br>\n",
    "- As a result, **the transaction ripples outwards from the originating node, flooding across the network, until all nodes in the network have a copy of the transaction**. Nodes can filter the messages they propagate, but the default is to propagate all valid transaction messages they receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Within just a few seconds, an Ethereum transaction propagates to all the Ethereum nodes around the globe. From the perspective of each node, it is not possible to discern the origin of the transaction. The neighbor that sent it to our node may be the originator of the transaction or may have received it from one of its neighbors**. To be able to track the origin of transactions, or interfere with propagation, an attacker would have to control a significant percentage of all nodes. This is part of the security and privacy design of P2P networks, especially as applied to blockchain networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recording on the blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "While all the nodes in Ethereum are equal peers, some of them are operated by miners and are feeding transactions and blocks to mining farms, which are computers with high-performance Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). **The mining computers add transactions to a candidate block and attempt to find a Proof-of-Work that makes the candidate block valid**. We will discuss this in more detail in Consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going into too much detail, valid transactions will eventually be included in a block of transactions and, thus, recorded in the Ethereum blockchain. **Once mined into a block, transactions also modify the state of the Ethereum singleton, either by modifying the balance of an account (in the case of a simple payment), or by invoking contracts that change their internal state. These changes are recorded alongside the transaction, in the form of a transaction receipt, which may also include events**. We will examine all this in much more detail in EVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our transaction has completed its journey from creation to signing by an EOA, propagation, and finally mining. It has changed the state of the singleton and left an indelible mark on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple signatures (multisig) transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities, you know that it is possible to create a Bitcoin multisig account which can only spend funds when multiple parties sign the transaction (e.g. 2 of 2 or 3 of 4 signatures). **Ethereum’s basic EOA value transactions have no provisions for multiple signatures, however arbitrary signing restrictions can be enforced by smart contracts with any conditions you can think of to handle the transfer of ether and tokens alike. This is one of the main advantages of the Ethereum protocol: <u> fully programmable money</u>.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To take advantage of this capability, ether has to be transferred to a \"wallet contract\" that is programmed with the spending rules desired, such as multi-signature requirements or spending limits (or combinations of the two). The wallet contract then officially sends the funds when prompted by an authorized EOA once the spending conditions have been satisfied.** For example, to protect your ether under a multisig condition, transfer the ether to a multisig contract. Whenever you want to send funds to another account, all the required users will need to send transactions to the contract using a regular wallet app, effectively authorizing the contract to perform the final transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These contracts can also be designed to require multiple signatures before executing local code or to trigger other contracts. **The security of the scheme is ultimately determined by the multisig contract code.**\n",

    "- EOA are simple accounts without any associated code or data storage, whereas **contract accounts have both associated code and data storage. **<br><br>\n",
    "- EOAs are controlled by transactions created and cryptographically signed with a private key in the \"real world\" external to and independent of the protocol, whereas **contract accounts do not have private keys and so \"control themselves\" in the predetermined way prescribed by their smart contract code**.<br><br>\n",
    "- Both types of accounts are identified by an Ethereum address. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss contract accounts, and **the program code that controls the contract accounts: smart contracts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a smart contract?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term smart contract has been used over the years to describe a wide variety of different things. In the 1990’s, cryptographer Nick Szabo coined the term and defined it as **“a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on the other promises”**. Since then, the concept of smart contracts has evolved, especially after the introduction of decentralized blockchain platforms with the invention of Bitcoin in 2009. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In the context of Ethereum, the term is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that Ethereum smart contracts are neither smart nor legal contracts, but the term has stuck.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, **we use the term “smart contract” to refer to immutable computer programs that run deterministically in the context of an Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Ethereum network protocol, i.e. on the decentralized Ethereum world computer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s unpack that definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computer programs**: Smart contracts are simply computer programs. The word contract has no legal meaning in this context.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable**: Once deployed, the code of a smart contract cannot change. Unlike traditional software, the only way to modify a smart contract is to deploy a new instance.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic**: The outcome of the execution of a smart contract is the same for everyone who runs it, given the context of the transaction that initiated its execution and the state of the Ethereum blockchain at the moment of execution.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The EVM context**: Smart contracts operate with a very limited execution context. They can access their own state, the context of the transaction that called them and some information about the most recent blocks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decentralized world computer**: The EVM runs as a local instance on every Ethereum node, but because all instances of the EVM operate on the same initial state and produce the same final state, the system as a whole operates as a single \"world computer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lifecycle of a smart contract\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smart contracts are typically written in a high-level language, such as Solidity. But in order to run, they must be compiled to the low-level bytecode that runs in the EVM. Once compiled, they are deployed on the Ethereum platform using a special contract creation transaction which is identified as such by being sent to the special contract creation address, namely 0x0.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Each contract is identified by an Ethereum address, which is derived from the contract creation transaction as a function of the originating account and nonce.** The Ethereum address of a contract can be used in a transaction as the recipient, sending funds to the contract or calling one of the contract’s functions. **Note that, unlike EOAs, there are no keys associated with an account created for a new smart contract. As the contract creator, you don’t get any special privileges at the protocol level (although you can explicitly code them into the smart contract, of course)**. You certainly don’t receive the private key for the contract account - it does’t exist - we can say that <u>smart contract accounts own themselves</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, contracts only run if they are called by a transaction. **All smart contracts in Ethereum are executed, ultimately, because of a transaction initiated from an Externally Owned Account. A contract can call another contract that can call another contract, and so on, but the first contract in such a chain of execution will always have been called by a transaction from an EOA**. Contracts never run “on their own”, or “run in the background”. Contracts effectively lie “**dormant**” until a transaction triggers execution, either directly or indirectly as part of a chain of contract calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "> It is also worth noting that smart contracts are not executed \"in parallel\" in any sense - the **Ethereum world computer can be considered to be a single-threaded machine**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions are atomic**, regardless of how many contracts they call or what those contracts do when called. Transactions execute in their entirety, with any changes in the global state (contracts, accounts, etc.) recorded only if all execution terminates successfully. Successful termination means that the program executed without an error and reached the end of execution. **If execution fails due to an error, all of its effects (changes in state) are “rolled back” as if the transaction never ran. A failed transaction is still recorded as having been attempted, and the ether spent on gas for the execution is deducted from the originating account**, but it otherwise has no other effects on contract or account state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, it important to remember that a **contract’s code cannot be changed. However a contract can be “deleted”, removing the code and it’s internal state (storage) from its address, leaving a blank account**. Any transactions sent to that account address after the contract has been deleted do not result in any code execution, because there is no longer any code there to execute. **To delete a contract, you execute an EVM opcode called SELFDESTRUCT (previously called SUICIDE). That operation costs “negative gas”, a gas refund, thereby incentivizing the release of network client resources from the deletion of stored state. Deleting a contract in this way does not remove the transaction history (past) of the contract, since the blockchain itself is immutable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **It is also important to note that the SELFDESTRUCT capability will only be available if the contract author programmed the smart contract to have that functionality**. If the contract’s code does not have a SELFDESTRUCT opcode, or it is inaccessible, the smart contract can not be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Ethereum high-level languages\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EVM is an virtual machine that runs a special form of machine code called EVM bytecode, just like your computer’s CPU, which runs machine code such as x86_64**. We will examine the operation and language of the EVM in much more detail later. In this section we will look at how smart contracts are written to run on the EVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to program smart contracts directly in bytecode, EVM bytecode is rather unwieldy and very difficult for programmers to read and understand. **Instead, most Ethereum developers use a high-level language to write programs, and a compiler to convert them into bytecode.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While any high-level language could be adapted to write smart contracts, adapting an arbitrary language to be compilable to EVM bytecode is quite a cumbersome exercise and would in general lead to some amount of confusion. **Smart contracts operate in a highly constrained and minimalistic execution environment (the EVM), where almost all of the usual user interfaces, operating system interfaces and hardware interfaces are not there. In addition, a special set of EVM specific system variables and functions need to be available. As such, it is easier to build a smart-contract language from scratch, than it is to constrain a general-purpose language and make it suitable for writing smart contracts**. As a result, a number of special-purpose languages have emerged for programming smart contracts. Ethereum has several such languages, together with the compilers needed to produce EVM-executable bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, **programming languages can be classified into two broad programming paradigms: declarative and imperative, also known as “functional” and “procedural”, respectively**.\n",
    "- In **Declarative programming**, we write functions that express the logic of a program, but not its flow. Declarative programming is used to create programs where there are no side effects, meaning that there are no changes to state outside of a function. Declarative programming languages include, for example, Haskell, SQL and HTML. <br><br>\n",
    "- **Imperative programming**, by contrast, is where a programmer writes a set of procedures that combine the logic and flow of a program. Imperative programming languages include, for example, BASIC, C, C++, and Java. <br><br>\n",
    "- Some languages are “**hybrid**”, meaning that they encourage declarative programming but can also be used to express an imperative programming paradigm. Such hybrids include Lisp, Erlang, Prolog, JavaScript, and Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, **any imperative language can be used to write in a declarative paradigm, but it often results in inelegant code. By comparison, pure declarative languages cannot be used to write in an imperative paradigm.** In purely declarative languages, there are no “variables”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**While imperative programming is easier to write and read**, and is more commonly used by programmers, **it can be very difficult to write programs that execute exactly as expected**. The ability of any part of the program to change the state makes it difficult to reason about a program’s execution and introduces many opportunities for unintended side effects and bugs. **Declarative programming by comparison is harder to write, but avoids side effects, making it easier to understand how a program will behave**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief explanatory article: [Impreative vs Declarative Paradigm](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/imperative-versus-declarative-code-whats-the-difference-adc7dd6c8380)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smart contracts create a very high burden for programmers: bugs cost money. As a result, it is critically important to write smart contracts without unintended effects. To do that, you must be able to clearly reason about the expected behavior of the program. So, declarative languages play a much bigger role in smart contracts than they do in general purpose software. Nevertheless, as you will see below, the most prolific language for smart contracts (Solidity) is imperative.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently supported high-level programming languages for smart contracts include (ordered by approximate age):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLL**<br>\n",
    "A functional (declarative) programming language, with Lisp-like syntax. It was the first high-level language for Ethereum smart contracts (written by the co-author of this book, Gavin Wood), but it is rarely used today.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serpent**<br>\n",
    "A procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to Python. Can also be used to write functional (declarative) code, though it is not entirely free of side effects. Used sparsely. First created by Vitalik Buterin.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solidity**<br>\n",
    "A procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to JavaScript, C++ or Java. The most popular and most frequently used language for Ethereum smart contracts. Created by Gavin Wood (co-author of this book).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vyper**<br>\n",
    "A more recently developed language, similar to Serpent and again with Python-like syntax. Intended to get closer to a pure-functional Python-like language than Serpent, but not to replace Serpent. Created by Vitalik Buterin.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bamboo**<br>\n",
    "A newly developed language, influenced by Erlang with explicit state transitions and without iterative flows (loops). Intended to reduce side effects and increase auditability. Very new and yet to be widely adopted.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are many languages to choose from. However, **of all these Solidity is by far the most popular, to the point of being the de-facto high-level language of Ethereum and even other EVM-like blockchains**. We will spend most of our time using Solidity, but will also explore some of the examples in other high-level languages, to gain an understanding of their different philosophies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a smart contract with Solidity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solidity was created by Gavin Wood (co-author of this book) as a language explicitly for writing smart contracts with features to directly support execution in the decentralized environment of the Ethereum world computer**. The resulting attributes are quite general and so it has ended up being used for coding smart contracts on several other blockchain platforms. It was developed by Christian Reitiwessner and then also by Alex Beregszaszi, Liana Husikyan, Yoichi Hirai and several former Ethereum core contributors. Solidity is now developed and maintained as the Solidity project on GitHub: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main \"product\" of the Solidity project is the Solidity Compiler (solc) which converts programs written in the Solidity language to EVM bytecode. The project also manages the important Application Binary Interface (ABI) standard for Ethereum smart contracts**, which we will explore in detail in this chapter. **Each version of the Solidity compiler corresponds to and compiles a specific version of the Solidity language.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will download a binary executable of the Solidity compiler. Then we will develop and compile a simple contract, following on from the example we started with in Introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting a version of Solidity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solidity follows a versioning model called semantic versioning (https://semver.org/), which specifies version numbers structured as three numbers separated by dots: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.**\n",
    "- The \"**major**\" number is incremented for major and backwards incompatible changes, \n",
    "- the \"**minor**\" number is incremented as backwards compatible features are added in between major releases, and\n",
    "- the \"**patch**\" number is incremented for bug-fix and security related changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Solidity is at version 0.4.21, where 0.4 is the major version, 21 is the minor version and anything specified after that is a patch release. The 0.5 major version release of Solidity is anticipated imminently.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, our **Solidity programs can contain a `pragma` directive that specifies the minimum and maximum version of Solidity that it is compatible with, and can be used to compile your contract.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Solidity is rapidly evolving it is best to always use the latest release.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and Install\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of methods you can use to download and install Solidity, either as a binary release or to compile from source code. You can find detailed instruction in the Solidity documentation at: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html\n",
    "\n",
    "In Installing solc on Ubuntu/Debian with apt package manager, you can see how to install the latest binary release of Solidity on an Ubuntu/Debian operating system, using the apt package manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing solc on Ubuntu/Debian with apt package manager\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum\n",
    "$ sudo apt update\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop in Solidity, you can use any text editor and solc on the command-line. However, you might find that some text editors designed for development, such as Atom, offer additional features such as syntax highlighting and macros that make Solidity development easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also web-based development environments, such as Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/), and EthFiddle (https://ethfiddle.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the tools that make you productive. In the end, Solidity programs are just plain-text files. While fancy editors and development environments can make things a bit easier, you don’t need anything more than a simple text editor, such as vim (Linux/Unix), TextEdit (MacOS) or even NotePad (Windows). Simply save your program source code with a .sol extension and it will be recognized by the Solidity compiler as a Solidity program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing a simple Solidity program\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introductory lessons, we wrote our first Solidity program, called Faucet. When we first built the Faucet, we used the Remix IDE to compile and deploy the contract. In this section, we will revisit, improve, and embellish Faucet.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",

    "        // Limit withdrawal amount\n",
    "        require(withdraw_amount <= 100000000000000000);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Send the amount to the address that requested it\n",

    "### Compiling with the Solidity compiler (solc)\n",

    "**In computer software, an Application Binary Interface (ABI) is an interface between two program modules; often, one at the level of machine code, and the other at the level of a program run by a user. An ABI defines how data structures and functions are accessed in machine code; this is not to be confused with an API, which defines this access in high-level, often human-readable formats as source code. The ABI is thus the primary way of encoding and decoding data into and out of machine code.**\n",

Using the ABI, an application such as a wallet or DApp browser can construct transactions that call the functions in Faucet, with the correct arguments and argument types.** \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a wallet would know that to call the function withdraw it would have to provide a uint256 argument named withdraw_amount. **The wallet could prompt the user to provide that value, then create a transaction that encodes it and executes the withdraw function.**\n",

Our contract is fairly simple, but what if our program used a feature that was only added in Solidity version 0.4.19 and we tried to compile it with 0.4.18?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve such issues, Solidity offers a **compiler directive** known as a **version pragma** that instructs the compiler that the program expects a specific compiler (and language) version. Let’s look at an example:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "- **FunctionName**<br>\n",
    "Defines the name of the function, which is used to call the function in a transaction (from an EOA), from another contract, or even from within the same contract. One function in each contract may be defined without a name, in which case it is the fallback function, which is called when no other function is named. The fallback function cannot have any arguments or return anything.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **parameters**<br>\n",
    "Following the name, we specify the arguments that must be passed to the function, with their names and types. In our Faucet example we defined uint withdraw_amount as the only argument to the withdraw function.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The next set of keywords (public, private, internal, external) specify the function’s visibility**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **public**<br>\n",
    "Public is the default and such functions can be called by other contracts, EOA transactions or from within the contract. In our Faucet example, both functions are defined as public.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **external**<br>\n",
    "External functions are like public, except they cannot be called from within the contract, unless they are prefixed with the keyword this.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **internal**<br>\n",
    "Internal functions are only accessible from within the contract - they cannot be called by another contract or EOA transaction. They can be called by derived contracts (those that inherit this one).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **private**<br>\n",
    "Private functions are like internal functions but they cannot be called by derived contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind, the terms <u>internal and private are somewhat misleading</u>. **Any function or data inside a contract is always visible on the public blockchain, meaning that anyone can see the code or data. The keywords above only affect how and when a function can be called.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The next set of keywords **(pure, constant, view, payable) affect the behavior of the function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **constant or view**<br>\n",
    "A function marked as a view, promises not to modify any state. The term constant is an alias for view that will be deprecated. At this time, the compiler does not enforce the view modifier, only producing a warning, but this is expected to become an enforced keyword in v0.5 of Solidity.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pure**<br>\n",
    "A pure function is one that neither reads nor writes any variables in storage. It can only operate on arguments and return data, without reference to any stored data. Pure functions are intended to encourage declarative-style programming without side-effects or state.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **payable**<br>\n",
    "A payable function is one that can accept incoming payments. Functions without payable will reject incoming payments. **There are two exceptions, due to design decisions in the EVM: coinbase payments and SELFDESTRUCT inheritance will be paid, even if the fallback function is not attributed as payable**, but this makes sense because code execution is not part of those payments anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in our Faucet example, we have one payable function (the fallback function), which is the only function that can receive incoming payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contract constructor and selfdestruct\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a special function that is only used once. **When a contract is created, it also runs the constructor function if one exists, to initialize the state of the contract. The constructor is run in the same transaction as the contract creation**. The constructor function is optional. In fact, our Faucet example has no constructor function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructors can be specified in two ways. **Up to Solidity v.0.4.21, the constructor is a function whose name matches the name of the contract**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor function prior to Solidity v0.4.22\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract MEContract {\n",
    "\tfunction MEContract() {\n",
    "\t\t// This is the constructor\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The difficulty with this format is that if the contract name is changed and the constructor function name is not changed, it is no longer a constructor. Likewise, if there is an accidental typo in the naming of the contract and/or constructor, the function is again no longer a constructor**. This can cause some pretty nasty, unexpected and difficult to notice bugs.\n",
    "> Imagine for example if the constructor is setting the owner of the contract for purposes of control. If the function is not actually the constructor because of a naming error, not only will the owner be left unset at the time of contract creation, but the function may also be deployed as a permanent and \"callable\" part of the contract, like a normal function, allowing any third party to hijack the contract and become the \"owner\" after contract creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the potential problems with constructor functions being based on having an identical name as the contract, **Solidity v0.4.22 introduces a \"constructor keyword\" that operates like a constructor function but does not have a name. Renaming the contract does not affect the constructor at all. Also, it is easier to identify which function is the constructor**. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "pragma ^0.4.22\n",
    "contract MEContract {\n",
    "\tconstructor () {\n",
    "\t\t// This is the constructor\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to summarize, **a contract’s lifecycle starts with a creation transaction from an EOA or contract account. If there is a constructor, it is executed as part of contract creation, to initialize the state of the contract as it is being created, and is then discarded.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The other end of the contract’s lifecycle is contract destruction. Contracts are destroyed by a special EVM opcode called SELFDESTRUCT**. It used to be called SUICIDE, but that name was deprecated due to the negative associations of the word. **In Solidity, this opcode is exposed as a high level built-in function called selfdestruct, which takes one argument: the address to receive any ether balance remaining in the contract account**. It looks like this:<br>\n",
    "`selfdestruct(address recipient);`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that you must explicitly add this command to your contract if you want it to be deletable - this is the only way a contract can be deleted, and it is not present by default**. In this way, users of a contract who might rely on a contract being there forever, can be certain that a contract can not be deleted if it doesn’t have a SELFDESTRUCT opcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding a constructor and selfdestruct to our Faucet example\n",
    "\n",
    "The Faucet example contract does not have any constructor or selfdestruct functions. It is an eternal contract that cannot be deleted. Let’s change that, by adding a constructor and selfdestruct function. **We probably want the selfdestruct to be callable only by the EOA that originally created the contract. By convention, this is usually stored in an address variable, called `owner`. Our constructor sets the owner variable and the selfdestruct function will first check that the owner called it directly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "First our constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for\n",
    "pragma solidity ^0.4.22;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Our first contract is a faucet!\n",
    "contract Faucet {\n",
    "\n",
    "\taddress owner;\n",
    "\n",
    "\t// Initialize Faucet contract: set owner\n",
    "\tconstructor() {\n",
    "\t\towner = msg.sender;\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\n",
    "[...]\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We’ve changed the pragma directive to specify v0.4.22 as the minimum version for this example, as we are using the new constructor keyword that only exists as of v.0.4.22 of Solidity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our contract now has an address type variable named owner. **The name \"owner\" is not special in any way. We could call this address variable \"potato\" and still use it the same way. The name owner simply makes the intention and purpose clear.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, our constructor, which runs as part of the contract creation transaction, assigns the address from msg.sender to the owner variable. **We’ve used the msg.sender in the withdraw function to identify the initiator of the withdrawal request. In the constructor however, the msg.sender is the EOA or contract address that initiated contract creation. We know this is the case because this is a constructor function: it only runs once and only as a result of contract creation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, now we can add a function to destroy the contract. We need to make sure that only the owner can run this function, so we will use a require statement to control access. Here’s how it will look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// Contract destructor\n",
    "function destroy() public {\n",
    "\trequire(msg.sender == owner);\n",
    "\tselfdestruct(owner);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**If anyone other calls this destroy function from an address other than owner, it will fail. But if the same address stored in owner by the constructor calls it, the contract will selfdestruct and send any remaining balance to the owner address.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We did not use the unsafe tx.origin to determine whether the owner wished to destroy the contract - using tx.orgin would allow malign contracts to destroy your contract even if you didn’t want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solidity offers a special type of function which is called a function modifier. You apply modifiers to functions by adding the modifier name in the function declaration. Modifier functions are most often used to create conditions that apply to many functions within a contract**. We have an access control statement already, in our destroy function. Let’s create a function modifier that expresses that condition:\n",
    "onlyOwner function modifier\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "modifier onlyOwner {\n",
    "    require(msg.sender == owner);\n",
    "    _;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we see the declaration of a function modifier, named onlyOwner. This function modifier sets a condition on any function that it modifies, requiring that the address stored as the owner of the contract is the same as the address of the transaction’s msg.sender. **This is the basic design pattern for access control, allowing only the owner of a contract to execute any function that has the onlyOwner modifier.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**You may have noticed that our function modifier has a peculiar syntactic \"placeholder\" in it, an underscore followed by a semicolon `(_;)`. This placeholder is replaced by the code of the function that is being modified.** Essentially, the modifier is \"**wrapped around**\" the modified function, placing its code in the location identified by the underscore character.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To apply a modifier, you add its name to the function declaration. More than one modifier can be applied to a function, as a comma-separated list, applied in the sequence they are declared.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s re-write our destroy function to use the onlyOwner modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function destroy() public onlyOwner {\n",
    "    selfdestruct(owner);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function modifier’s name (onlyOwner) is after the keyword public and tells us that the destroy function is modified by the onlyOwner modifier. Essentially you can read this as \"Only the owner can destroy this contract\". In practice, the resulting code is equivalent to \"wrapping\" the code from onlyOwner around destroy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function modifiers are an extremely useful tool because they allow us to write preconditions for functions and apply them consistently, making the code easier to read and, as a result, easier to audit for security**. They are most often used for access control, as in the example onlyOwner function modifier, but are quite versatile and can be used for a variety of other purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inside a modifier, you can access all the symbols (variables and arguments) visible to the modified function**. In this case, we can access the owner variable, which is declared within the contract. However, the inverse is not true: you cannot access any of the modifier’s variables inside the modified function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contract inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solidity’s contract object supports inheritance, which is a mechanism for extending a base contract with additional functionality**. To use inheritance, specify a parent contract with the keyword **is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract Child is Parent {\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With this construct, the Child contract inherits all the methods, functionality, and variables of Parent. Solidity also supports multiple inheritance**, which can be specified by comma-separated contract names after the keyword is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract Child is Parent1, Parent2 {\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contract inheritance allows us to write our contracts in such a way as to achieve modularity, extensibility and reuse.** \n",
    "> We start with contracts that are simple and implement the most generic capabilities, then extend them by inheriting those capabilities in more specialized contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Faucet contract, we introduced the constructor and destructor, together with access control for an owner, assigned on construction. Those capabilities are quite generic: many contracts will have them. We can define them as generic contracts, then use inheritance to extend them to the Faucet contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining a base contract owned, which has an owner variable, setting it in the contract’s constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract owned {\n",
    "\taddress owner;\n",
    "\n",
    "\t// Contract constructor: set owner\n",
    "\tconstructor() {\n",
    "\t\towner = msg.sender;\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\n",
    "\t// Access control modifier\n",
    "\tmodifier onlyOwner {\n",
    "\t    require(msg.sender == owner);\n",
    "\t    _;\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define a base contract mortal, which inherits owned:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract mortal is owned {\n",
    "\t// Contract destructor\n",
    "\tfunction destroy() public onlyOwner {\n",
    "\t\tselfdestruct(owner);\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the mortal contract can utilize the onlyOwner function modifier, defined in owned. It indirectly also uses the owner address variable and the constructor defined in owned. **Inheritance makes each contract simpler and focused on the specific functionality of its class, allowing us to manage the details in a modular way.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can further extend the owned contract, inheriting its capabilities in Faucet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract Faucet is mortal {\n",
    "    // Give out ether to anyone who asks\n",
    "    function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {\n",
    "        // Limit withdrawal amount\n",
    "        require(withdraw_amount <= 0.1 ether);\n",
    "        // Send the amount to the address that requested it\n",
    "        msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    // Accept any incoming amount\n",
    "    function () public payable {}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**By inheriting mortal, which in turn inherits owned, the Faucet contract now has the constructor and destroy functions, and a defined owner**. The functionality is the same as when those functions were within Faucet, but now we can reuse those functions in other contracts without writing them again. Code re-use and modularity make our code cleaner, easier to read, and easier to audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error handling (assert, require, revert)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A contract call can terminate and return an error. Error handling in Solidity is handled by four functions:**\n",
    "- assert, \n",
    "- require, \n",
    "- revert, and \n",
    "- throw (now deprecated).\n",
    "\n",
    "**When a contract terminates with an error, all the state changes (changes to variables, balances, etc.) are reverted, all the way up the chain of contract calls, if more than one contract were called. This ensures that transactions are atomic, meaning they either complete successfully or have no effect on state and are reverted entirely.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The assert and require functions operate in the same way, evaluating a condition and stopping execution with an error if the condition is false**. By convention, assert is used when the outcome is expected to be true, meaning that we use assert to test internal conditions. By comparison, require is used when testing inputs (such as function arguments or transaction fields), setting our expectations for those conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve used require in our function modifier onlyOwner, to test that the message sender is the owner of the contract:<br>\n",
    "```js\n",
    "require(msg.sender == owner);```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The require function acts as a gate condition, preventing execution of the rest of the function and producing an error if it is not satisfied.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Solidity v.0.4.22, require can also include a helpful text message, that can be used to show the reason for the error. The error message is recorded in the transaction log. So we can improve our code, by adding an error message in our require function:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "**Certain conditions in a contract will generate errors regardless of whether we explicitly check for them**. For example, in our Faucet contract, we don’t check whether there is enough ether to satisfy a withdrawal request. That’s because the transfer function will fail with an error and revert the transaction if there is insufficient balance to make the transfer:\n",

    "### Events\n",
    "\n",
    "**Events are Solidity constructs that facilitate the production of transaction logs. When a transaction completes (successfully or not), it produces a transaction receipt**, as we will see in EVM section. **The transaction receipt contains log entries that provide information about the actions that occurred during the execution of the transaction. Events are the Solidity high-level objects that are used to construct these logs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Events are especially useful for light clients and DApp services, which can \"watch\" for specific events and report them to the user-interface, or make a change in the state of the application to reflect an event in an underlying contract.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event objects take arguments that are serialized and recorded in the transaction logs, in the blockchain**. You can supply the keyword **indexed**, before an argument, to make the value part of an indexed table (hash table) that can be searched or filtered by an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not added any events in our Faucet example, so far, so let’s do that. We will add two events, one to log any withdrawals and one to log any deposits. We will call these events Withdrawal and Deposit respectively. First, we define the events, in the Faucet contract:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",

    "\n",
    "We’ve chosen to make the addresses indexed, to allow searching and filtering in any user interface built to access our Faucet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the emit keyword to incorporate the event data in the transaction logs:\n",

    "### Calling other contracts (send, call, callcode, delegatecall)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calling other contracts from within your contract is a very useful but potentially dangerous operation. We’ll examine the various ways you can achieve this and evaluate the risks of each method. In short, the risks develop out of the fact that you may have no idea about a contract you are calling into or no idea about who is calling into your contract**When writing smart contracts, you must keep in mind that, while you are mostly expecting to be dealing with EOAs perhaps, there is nothing to stop arbitrarily complex and perhaps malign contracts from calling into and being called by your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a new instance\n",
    "\n",
    "**The safest way to call another contract is if you create that other contract yourself. That way, you are certain of its interfaces and behavior**. To do this, you can simply instantiate it, using the keyword new, as with any object-oriented language. In Solidity, the keyword new will create the contract on the blockchain and return an object that you can use to reference it. Let’s say you want to create and call a Faucet contract, from within another contract called Token:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract Token is mortal {\n",
    "\tFaucet _faucet;\n",
    "\n",
    "\tconstructor() {\n",
    "\t\t_faucet = new Faucet();\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism for contract construction ensures that you know the exact type of contract and its interface. The contract Faucet must be defined within the scope of Token, which you can do with an import statement, if the definition is in another file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "import \"Faucet.sol\";\n",
    "\n",
    "contract Token is mortal {\n",
    "\tFaucet _faucet;\n",
    "\n",
    "\tconstructor() {\n",
    "\t\t_faucet = new Faucet();\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The new keyword can also accept optional parameters to specify the value of ether transfer on creation, and arguments passed to the new contract’s constructor**, if any:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "import \"Faucet.sol\";\n",
    "\n",
    "contract Token is mortal {\n",
    "\tFaucet _faucet;\n",
    "\n",
    "\tconstructor() {\n",
    "\t\t_faucet = (new Faucet).value(0.5 ether)();\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also then call the Faucet functions, which operate just like a method call. In this example, we call the destroy function of Faucet, from within the destroy function of Token:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "import \"Faucet.sol\";\n",
    "\n",
    "contract Token is mortal {\n",
    "\tFaucet _faucet;\n",
    "\n",
    "\tconstructor() {\n",
    "\t\t_faucet = (new Faucet).value(0.5 ether)();\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\n",
    "\tfunction destroy() ownerOnly {\n",
    "\t\t_faucet.destroy();\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **While you are the owner of the Token contract, it is the Token contract itself that is the owner of the new Faucet contract, so only the Token contract can destroy this one.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addressing an existing instance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another way we can use to call a contract, is to cast the address of an existing instance of the contract**. With this method, we apply a known interface to an existing instance. It is therefore critically important that we know, for sure, that the instance we are addressing is in fact of the same type as we assume. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "import \"Faucet.sol\";\n",
    "\n",
    "contract Token is mortal {\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFaucet _faucet;\n",
    "\n",
    "\tconstructor(address _f) {\n",
    "\t\t_faucet = Faucet(_f);\n",
    "\t\t_faucet.withdraw(0.1 ether)\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here, we take an address provided as an argument to the constructor, \\_f, and we cast it as a Faucet object. This is much riskier than the previous mechanism, because we don’t know for sure whether that address is a Faucet object in the exact way we plan to treat it**. When we call withdraw, we are assuming that it accepts the same arguments and executes the same code as our Faucet declaration, but we can’t be sure. For all we know, the withdraw function at this address could execute something completely different from what we expect, even if it is named the same. Using addresses passed as input and casting them into specific objects is therefore much more dangerous than creating the contract ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Raw call, delegatecall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solidity offers some even more \"low-level\" functions for calling other contracts**. These correspond directly to EVM opcodes of the same name and allow us to construct a contract-to-contract call manually. As such, **they represent the most flexible and the most dangerous mechanisms for calling other contracts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the same example, using a call method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract Token is mortal {\n",
    "\tconstructor(address _faucet) {\n",
    "\t\t_faucet.call(\"withdraw\", 0.1 ether);\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this type of call, is a blind call into a function, very much like constructing a raw transaction, only from within a contract’s context. It can expose our contract to a number of security risks, most importantly re-entrancy, which we will talk about in more detail later. The call function will return false if there is a problem, so we can evaluate the return value, for error handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract Token is mortal {\n",
    "\tconstructor(address _faucet) {\n",
    "\t\tif !(_faucet.call(\"withdraw\", 0.1 ether)) {\n",
    "\t\t\trevert(\"Withdrawal from faucet failed\");\n",
    "\t\t}\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another variant of **call is delegatecall, which replaced the more dangerous callcode. The callcode method will be deprecated soon, so it should not be used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in Address object, **a delegatecall is different from a call, in that the msg context does not change. For example, whereas a call changes the value of msg.sender to be the calling contract, a delegatecall keeps the same msg.sender as it is in the calling contract**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Essentially, delegatecall runs the code of another contract inside the context of the execution of the current contract. It is most often used to invoke code from a library. It also allows you to draw on the pattern of using library functions stored elsewhere, but have that code work with the storage data of your contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The delegate call should be used with great caution**. It can have some unexpected effects, especially if the contract you call was not designed as a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use an example contract to demonstrate the various call semantics used by call and delegatecall for calling libraries and contracts. We use an event to log the details of each call and see how the calling context changes depending on the call type:\n",
    "[CallExamples.sol](https://github.com/Parsh24/ethereumbook/tree/develop/code/truffle/CallExamples): An example of different call semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main contract is caller, which calls a library calledLibrary and a contract calledContract. Both the called library and contract have identical functions calledFunction, which emit an event calledEvent. The event calledEvent logs three pieces of data: msg.sender, tx.origin, and this. Each time calledFunction is called it may have a different execution context (with different values for the potentially all the context variables), depending on whether it is called directly or through delegatecall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In caller, we first call the contract and library directly, by invoking the calledFunction in each. Then, we explicitly use the low-level functions call and delegatecall to call the calledContract.calledFunction. This way we can see how the various calling mechanisms behave.\n",
    "\n",

    "Gas is described in more in detail in later section and is an incredibly important consideration in smart contract programming. **Gas is a resource constraining the maximum amount of computation that Ethereum will allow a transaction to consume. If the gas limit is exceeded during computation, the following series of events occurs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An \"out of gas\" exception is thrown.\n",
    "- The state of the contract prior to execution is restored (reverted).\n",
    "- All ether used to pay for the gas is taken as a transaction fee; it is not refunded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because gas is paid by the user who initiates the transaction, users are discouraged from calling functions that have a high gas cost. **It is thus in the programmer’s best interest to minimize the gas cost of a contract’s functions. To this end, there are certain practices that are recommended when constructing smart contracts, so as to minimize the gas costs surrounding a function call.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid dynamically-sized arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Any loop through a dynamically sized array wherein a function performs operations on each element or searches for a particular element introduces the risk of using too much gas. Indeed, the contract may run out of gas before finding the desired result, or before acting on every element, thus wasting time and ether without giving any result at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid calls to other contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling other contracts, especially when the gas cost of their functions is not known, introduces the risk of running out of gas. Avoid using libraries that are not well tested and broadly used. The less scrutiny a library has received from other programmers, the greater the risk of using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimating gas cost\n",
    "\n",
    "In case that you need to estimate the gas necessary to execute a certain method of a contract considering its call arguments, you could, for instance, use the following procedure;\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var contract = web3.eth.contract(abi).at(address);\n",
    "var gasEstimate = contract.myAweSomeMethod.estimateGas(arg1, arg2, {from: account});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "gasEstimate will tell us the number of gas units needed for its execution. **It is an estimate because of the Turing completeness of the EVM** - it is relatively trivial to create a function that will take excessively different amounts of gas to execute on each subsequent call. Even production code can change execution paths in subtle ways resulting in hugely different gas costs from call to call. However, **most functions are sensible and estimateGas will give a very good estimate most of the time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the gas price from the network you can use;\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var gasPrice = web3.eth.getGasPrice();\n",
    "```\n",
    "And from there, estimate the gas cost;\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var gasCostInEther = web3.fromWei((gasEstimate * gasPrice), 'ether');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s apply our gas estimation functions to estimating the gas cost of our Faucet example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start truffle in development mode, and execute a JavaScript file gas_estimates.js, which contains:\n",
    "gas_estimates.js: Using the estimateGas function\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var FaucetContract = artifacts.require(\"./Faucet.sol\");\n",
    "\n",
    "FaucetContract.web3.eth.getGasPrice(function(error, result) {\n",
    "    var gasPrice = Number(result);\n",
    "    console.log(\"Gas Price is \" + gasPrice + \" wei\"); // \"10000000000000\"\n",

    "    // Get the contract instance\n",
    "    FaucetContract.deployed().then(function(FaucetContractInstance) {\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Use the keyword 'estimateGas' after the function name to get the gas estimation for this particular function (aprove)\n",
    "\t\tFaucetContractInstance.send(web3.toWei(1, \"ether\"));\n",
    "        return FaucetContractInstance.withdraw.estimateGas(web3.toWei(0.1, \"ether\"));\n",
    "\n",
    "    }).then(function(result) {\n",
    "        var gas = Number(result);\n",
    "\n",
    "        console.log(\"gas estimation = \" + gas + \" units\");\n",
    "        console.log(\"gas cost estimation = \" + (gas * gasPrice) + \" wei\");\n",
    "        console.log(\"gas cost estimation = \" + FaucetContract.web3.fromWei((gas * gasPrice), 'ether') + \" ether\");\n",
    "    });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how that looks in the truffle development console:\n",
    "```\n",
    "truffle develop\n",
    "\n",
    "truffle(develop)> exec gas_estimates.js\n",
    "Using network 'develop'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas Price is 20000000000 wei\n",
    "gas estimation = 31397 units\n",
    "gas cost estimation = 627940000000000 wei\n",
    "gas cost estimation = 0.00062794 ether\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you evaluate the gas cost of functions as part of your development workflow, to avoid any surprises when deploying contracts to the mainnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is one of the most important considerations when writing smart contracts. In the field of smart-contract programming, mistakes are costly and easily exploited. As with other programs, a smart contract will execute exactly what is written, which is not always what the programmer intended. Furthermore, all smart contracts are public and any user can interact with them simply by creating a transaction. **Any vulnerability can be exploited and losses are almost always impossible to recover. It is therefore critical to follow best practices and use well tested design patterns.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defensive programming is a style of programming that is particularly well suited to programming smart contracts and has the following characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimalism/Simplicity**<br>\n",
    "Complexity is the enemy of security. The simpler the code, and the less it does, the lower the chance of a bug or unforeseen effect. When first engaging in smart-contract programming, developers are tempted to try to write a lot of code. Instead, you should look through your smart-contract code and try to find ways to do less, with fewer lines of code, with less complexity and with fewer \"features\". **If someone tells you that their project has produced \"thousands of lines of code\" for their smart contracts, you should question the security of that project. Simpler is more secure.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code re-use**<br>\n",
    "As much as possible, try not to \"reinvent the wheel\". If a library or contract already exists that does most of what you need, re-use it. **Within your own code, follow the DRY principle: Do not Repeat Yourself. If you see any snippet of code repeat more than once, ask yourself whether it could be written as a function or library and re-used**. Code that has been extensively used and tested is likely more secure than any new code you write. **Beware of any Not-Invented-Here attitude, where you are tempted to \"improve\" a feature or component by building it from scratch. The security risk is often greater than the improvement value.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code quality**<br>\n",
    "**Smart-contract code is unforgiving. Every bug can lead to monetary loss. You should not treat smart-contract programming the same way as general purpose programming**. Writing DApps in Solidity is not like creating a web widget in javascript. Rather, **you should apply rigorous engineering and software development methodologies, akin to aerospace engineering or a similarly unforgiving engineering discipline**. Once you \"launch\" your code, there’s little you can do to fix any problems.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability/Auditability**<br>\n",
    "Your code should be clear and easy to comprehend. **The easier it is to read, the easier it is to audit**. Smart contracts are public, as everyone can read the bytecode and anyone can reverse engineer it. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop your work in public, using collaborative and open source methodologies, to draw upon the collective wisdom of the developer community and benefit from the highest common denominator of open source development. **You should write code that is well documented and easy to read, following the style and naming conventions that are part of the Ethereum community.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test coverage**<br>\n",
    "Test everything that you can test. Smart contracts run in a public execution environment, where anyone can execute them with whatever input they want. You should never assume that input, such as function arguments, is well formed, properly bounded and has a benign purpose. Test all arguments to make sure they are within expected ranges and properly formatted before allowing execution of your code to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common security risks\n",
    "\n",
    "As a smart contract programmer, you should be familiar with the most common security risks, so as to be able to detect and avoid the programming patterns that leave them exposed to these risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Re-Entrancy\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the features of Ethereum smart contracts is the ability to call and utilise code of other external contracts. Contracts also typically handle ether, and as such often send ether to various external user addresses. The operation of calling external contracts, or sending ether to an address, requires the contract to submit an external call. **These external calls can be hijacked by attackers whereby they force the contract to execute further code (i.e. through a fallback function), including calls back into itself. Thus the code execution \"re-enters\" the contract.** Attacks of this kind were used in the infamous **DAO hack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading on re-entrancy attacks, see [Reentrancy Attack On Smart Contracts](https://medium.com/@gus_tavo_guim/reentrancy-attack-on-smart-contracts-how-to-identify-the-exploitable-and-an-example-of-an-attack-4470a2d8dfe4) or [Consensus - Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/#dos-with-unexpected-revert).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Vulnerability**\n",
    "\n",
    "This attack can occur when a contract sends ether to an unknown address. An attacker can carefully construct a contract at an external address which contains malicious code in the fallback function. Thus, when a contract sends ether to this address, it will invoke the malicious code. Typically the malicious code executes a function on the vulnerable contract, performing operations not expected by the developer. **The name \"re-entrancy\" comes from the fact that the external malicious contract calls back a function on the vulnerable contract and \"re-enters\" code execution at an arbitrary location on the vulnerable contract.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify this, consider the simple vulnerable contract, which acts as an Ethereum vault that allows depositors to only withdraw 1 ether per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "EtherStore.sol:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",

    "        require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());\n",
    "        balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;\n",
    "        lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us examine how this malicious contract can exploit the EtherStore contract. The attacker would create the above contract (let’s say at the address 0x0…​123) with the EtherStore’s contract address as the sole constructor parameter. This will initialize and point the public variable etherStore to the contract to be attacked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker would then call the attackEtherStore() function, with some amount of ether (greater than or equal to 1), let us assume 1 ether for the time being. In this example, we will also assume a number of other users have deposited ether into this contract, such that it’s current balance is 10 ether. The following would then occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attack.sol - Line [15] - The depositFunds() function of the EtherStore contract will be called with a msg.value of 1 ether (and a lot of gas). The sender (msg.sender) will be our malicious contract (0x0…​123). Thus, balances[0x0..123] = 1 ether.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attack.sol - Line [17] - The malicious contract will then call the withdrawFunds() function of the EtherStore contract with a parameter of 1 ether. This will pass all the requirements (Lines [12]-[16] of the EtherStore contract) as no previous withdrawals have been made.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. EtherStore.sol - Line [17] - The contract will then send 1 ether back to the malicious contract.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Attack.sol - Line [25] - The ether sent to the malicious contract will then execute the fallback function.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Attack.sol - Line [26] - The total balance of the EtherStore contract was 10 ether and is now 9 ether so this if statement passes.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Attack.sol - Line [27] - The fallback function then calls the EtherStore withdrawFunds() function again and 're-enters' the EtherStore contract.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. EtherStore.sol - Line [11] - In this second call to withdrawFunds(), the attacking contract’s balance is still 1 ether as line [18] has not yet been executed. Thus, we still have balances[0x0..123] = 1 ether. This is also the case for the lastWithdrawTime variable. Again, we pass all the requirements.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. EtherStore.sol - Line [17] - The attacking contract withdraws another 1 ether.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Steps 4-8 will repeat - until EtherStore.balance >= 1 as dictated by line [26] in Attack.sol.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Attack.sol - Line [26] - Once there less 1 (or less) ether left in the EtherStore contract, this if statement will fail. This will then allow lines [18] and [19] of the EtherStore contract to be executed (for each call to the withdrawFunds() function).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "11. EtherStore.sol - Lines [18] and [19] - The balances and lastWithdrawTime mappings will be set and the execution will end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result, is that the attacker has withdrawn all (bar 1) ether from the EtherStore contract, instantaneously with a single transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preventative Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of common techniques which help avoid potential re-entrancy vulnerabilities in smart contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first is to ( whenever possible) use the built-in transfer() function when sending ether to external contracts. The transfer function only sends 2300 gas with the external call, which is not enough for the destination address/contract to call another contract (i.e. re-enter the sending contract).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second technique is to ensure that all logic that changes state variables happen before ether is sent out of the contract (or any external call). In the EtherStore example, lines [18] and [19] of EtherStore.sol should be put before line [17]. **It is good practice to place any code that performs external calls to unknown addresses as the last operation in a localised function or piece of code execution. This is known as the <u>checks-effects-interactions pattern</u>.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A third technique is to introduce a mutex. That is, to add a state variable which locks the contract during code execution, preventing reentrancy calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying all of these techniques (all three are unnecessary, but is done for demonstrative purposes) to EtherStore.sol, gives the re-entrancy-free contract:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "contract EtherStore {\n",

    "#### Installing the truffle framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The truffle framework is made of several NodeJS packages. Before we install truffle, we need to have an up-to-date and working installation of NodeJS and the Node Package Manager (npm).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The recommended way to install NodeJS and npm, is to use the Node Version Manager (NVM), nvm**. Once we install nvm, it will handle all the dependencies and updates for us. We’ll follow the instructions found at: http://nvm.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "Once nvm is installed on your operating system, installing NodeJS is simple. We use the --lts flag to tell nvm that we want the most recent \"Long Term Support (LTS)\" version of NodeJS\n",
    "\n",
    "```nvm install --lts```\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm you have node and npm installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "node -v\n",
    "v8.9.4\n",
    "npm -v\n",
    "5.6.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a hidden file .nvmrc that contains the Node.js version supported by your DApp so developers just need to run nvm install in the root of the project directory and it will automatically install and switch to using that version.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "node -v > .nvmrc\n",
    "nvm install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking good. Now to install truffle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm -g install truffle\n",
    "truffle@4.0.6\n",
    "installed 1 package in 37.508s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrating a pre-built Truffle project (Truffle Box)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If we want to use or create a DApp that builds upon a pre-built boilerplate, then at the Truffle Boxes link we can choose an existing Truffle project, and then run the following to download and extract it**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```truffle unbox <BOX_NAME>```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a truffle project directory\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each project where we will use truffle, we create a project directory and initialize truffle within that directory. Truffle will create the necessary directory structure inside our project directory.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Customarily, we give the project directory a name that describes our project. For this example, we will use truffle to deploy our faucet contract from our earlier Faucet Example, and therefore we will name the project folder Faucet.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir Faucet\n",
    "cd Faucet\n",
    "Faucet\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once inside the Faucet directory, we initialize truffle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```truffle init```\n",
    "\n",
    "Truffle creates a directory structure and some default files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Faucet\n",
    "+---- contracts\n",
    "|   `---- Migrations.sol\n",
    "+---- migrations\n",
    "|   `---- 1_initial_migration.js\n",
    "+---- test\n",
    "+---- truffle-config.js\n",
    "`---- truffle.js\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use a number of JavaScript (nodeJS) support packages, in addition to truffle itself. We can install these with npm. We initialize the npm directory structure and accept the defaults suggested by npm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm init\n",
    "\n",
    "package name: (faucet)\n",
    "version: (1.0.0)\n",
    "description:\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this ok? (yes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can install the dependencies that we will use to make working with truffle easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```npm install dotenv truffle-wallet-provider ethereumjs-wallet```\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a node_modules directory with several thousand files, inside your Faucet directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to deploying the DApp to a cloud production or continuous integration environment **it is important to specify the `\"engines\"` field so that your Dapp is built with the correct Node.js version** and it’s associated dependencies are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Package.json \"engines\" field configuration link: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuring truffle\n",
    "\n",
    "Truffle creates some empty configuration files, truffle.js and truffle-config.js. On Windows systems the truffle.js name may cause a conflict when you try to run the command truffle and Windows attempts to run truffle.js instead. To avoid this, we will delete truffle.js and use truffle-config.js, in support of Windows users who, honestly, suffer enough already.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rm truffle.js```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we edit truffle-config.js and replace the contents with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "\tnetworks: {\n",
    "\t\tlocalnode: { // Whatever network our local node connects to\n",
    "\t\t\tnetwork_id: \"*\", // Match any network id\n",
    "\t\t\thost: \"localhost\",\n",
    "\t\t\tport: 8545,\n",
    "\t\t}\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration above is a good starting point. **It sets up one default Ethereum network (named localnode), which assumes you are running an Ethereum client (such as parity), either as a full node, or as a light client. This configuration will instruct truffle to communicate with the local node over RPC, on port 8545**. Truffle will use whatever Ethereum network the local node is connected to, such as the Ethereum main network, or a test network like Ropsten. The local node will also be providing the wallet functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In following sections, we will configure additional networks for truffle to use, such as the **ganache test-RPC blockchain** and **Infura - a hosted network provider**. As we add more networks, the configuration file will get more complex, but it will also give us more options for our testing and development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using truffle to deploy a contract\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a basic working directory for our Faucet project, and we have truffle and its dependencies configured. Contracts go in the contracts subdirectory of our project. The directory already contains a \"helper\" contract, Migrations.sol which manages contract upgrades for us. We’ll examine the use of Migrations.sol in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s copy the Faucet.sol contract into the contracts subdirectory, so that the project directory looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Faucet\n",
    "+---- contracts\n",
    "|   +---- Faucet.sol\n",
    "|   `---- Migrations.sol\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can now ask truffle to compile the contract for us:\n",
    "```\n",
    "truffle compile\n",
    "Compiling ./contracts/Faucet.sol...\n",
    "Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...\n",
    "Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Truffle migrations - understanding deployment scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Truffle offers a deployment system called a migration**. If you have worked in other frameworks, you may have seen something similar: Ruby on Rails, Python Django and many other languages and frameworks have a migrate command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all those frameworks, the purpose of a migration is to handle changes in the data schema between different versions of the software. The purpose of migrations in Ethereum is slightly different. Because **Ethereum contracts are immutable and cost gas to deploy, truffle offers a migration mechanism to keep track of which contracts (and which versions) have already been deployed. In a complex project with dozens of contracts and complex dependencies, you would not want to have to pay to redeploy contracts that haven’t changed**. You would also not want to manually track which versions of which contracts have been deployed already. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The truffle migration mechanism does all that by deploying the smart contract Migrations.sol, which then keeps track of all other contract deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have only one contract, Faucet.sol, which means that the migration system is overkill, to say the least. Unfortunately, we have to use it. But, by learning how to use it for one contract, we can start practicing some good habits for our development workflow. The effort will pay off as things get more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truffle’s migrations directory is where the migration scripts are found. Right now, there’s only one script **1_initial_migration.js, which deploys the Migrations.sol contract itself**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var Migrations = artifacts.require(\"./Migrations.sol\");\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = function(deployer) {\n",
    "  deployer.deploy(Migrations);\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a second migration script, to deploy Faucet.sol. Let’s call it **2_deploy_contracts.js. It is very simple, just like 1_initial_migration.js, with only a few small changes. In fact, you can copy the contents of 1_initial_migration.js and simply replace all instances of Migrations with Faucet**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var Faucet = artifacts.require(\"./Faucet.sol\");\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = function(deployer) {\n",
    "  deployer.deploy(Faucet);\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "**The script initializes a variable Faucet, identifying the Faucet.sol Solidity source code as the artifact that defines Faucet. Then, it calls the deploy function to deploy this contract.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re all set. Let’s use truffle migrate to deploy the contract. We have to specify on which network to deploy the contract, using the `--network` argument. We only have one network specified in the configuration file, which we named localnode. Make sure your local Ethereum client is running and then type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```truffle migrate --network localnode```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because we are using a local node to connect to the Ethereum network and manage our wallet, we have to authorize the transaction that truffle creates**. I’m running parity connected to the Ropsten test blockchain, so during the truffle migration I will see a pop-up on parity’s web console:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/parity_deployment_confirmation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see four transactions, total. One to deploy Migrations, one to update the deployments counter to 1, one to deploy Faucet and one to update the deployments counter to 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "The truffle console offers an auto-complete function that makes it easy for us to explore the environment.

    "\n",
    "[OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/) is an open framework of reusable and secure smart contracts in the Solidity language.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is community-driven, led by the [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.solutions/) team, with over a hundred external contributors. **The main focus of the framework is security, achieved by applying industry standard contract security patterns and best practices, taking advantage of all the experience the Zeppelin devs have gained from auditing a huge amount of contracts, and through the constant testing and auditing from the community that uses the framework as a base for their real world applications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The OpenZeppelin framework is the most widely used solution for Ethereum smart contracts. This is due to the community discussing every proposed solution and learning from the implementation and integration of these solutions, which turns into a growing feedback loop that improves the existing contracts and finds new possibilities to combine them in a clear and secure architecture**. It has resulted in the constant addition of new reusable contracts to solve increasingly complex challenges or explore exciting new possibilities on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As mentioned before, the framework currently has an ample library of contracts ranging from implementations of `ERC20` and `ERC721` tokens, to many flavors of crowdsale models, to simple behaviors commonly found in contracts such as `Ownable`, `Pausable` or `LimitBalance`. **The contracts in this repository in some cases even function as de facto standard implementations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework has an MIT license, and **all the contracts have been designed with a modular approach to guarantee ease of reuse and extension. These are clean and basic building blocks, ready to be used on your next Ethereum project**. Let’s set up the framework and build a simple crowdsale using the OpenZeppelin contracts, as an example of how easy it is to use. This example also stresses the importance of reusing secure components instead of writing them by yourself, and gives a small sample of the ideas that the Ethereum platform and its community are making possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will need to install the openzepelin-solidity library from npm into our workspace. The latest release as of the time of this writing is v1.9.0, so we will use that one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir sample-crowdsale\n",
    "cd sample-crowdsale\n",
    "npm install openzeppelin-solidity@1.9.0\n",
    "mkdir contracts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the crowdsale, we will need to define a token that we will give to the investors in exchange for their ether. At the time of writing, OpenZeppelin includes multiple basic token contracts that follow the `ERC20`, `ERC721` and `ERC827` standards, with different characteristics for emission, limits, vesting, lifecycle, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let’s make an ERC20 token that’s mintable, meaning that the initial supply starts at 0 and new tokens can be created by the token owner (in our case, the crowdsale contract) and assigned to the investors**. In order to do this, create a `contracts/SampleToken.sol` file with the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "pragma solidity 0.4.23;\n",
    "\n",
    "import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/MintableToken.sol';\n",
    "\n",
    "contract SampleToken is MintableToken {\n",
    "  string public name = \"SAMPLE TOKEN\";\n",
    "  string public symbol = \"SAM\";\n",
    "  uint8 public decimals = 18;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OpenZeppelin already provides a MintableToken contract that we can use as a base for our token, so we only define the details that are specific to our case**. You can trust that the community has put great effort to ensure the correctness of the contract, but it’s always better to verify this by ourselves. **Take a look at the source code for [MintableToken](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/token/ERC20/MintableToken.sol), [StandardToken](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol), and [Ownable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol) to understand the implementation details of your new token and the capabilities it supports. Also, take a look at the [automated tests](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/test/token/ERC20/MintableToken.test.js) it has, to make sure that all the possible scenarios have been covered and that the code is safe.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, **let’s make the crowdsale contract. Just like with tokens, OpenZeppelin already provides a wide variety of crowdsale flavors. Currently, you will find contracts for scenarios involving distribution, emission, price, and validation**. So, let’s say that you want to set a goal for your crowdsale and if it’s not met by the time the sale finishes, you want to refund all your investors. For that, you can use the [RefundableCrowdsale](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/distribution/RefundableCrowdsale.sol) contract. Maybe you want to define a crowdsale with an increasing price to incentivize early buyers; there is the [IncreasingPriceCrowdsale](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/price/IncreasingPriceCrowdsale.sol) contract just for that. Or maybe end the crowdsale when a specified amount of ether has been received by the contract [CappedCrowdsale](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/validation/CappedCrowdsale.sol), or set a finishing time with the [TimedCrowdsale](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/validation/TimedCrowdsale.sol) contract, or a whitelist of buyers with the [WhitelistedCrowdsale](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/validation/WhitelistedCrowdsale.sol) contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, **the OpenZeppelin contracts are basic building blocks. These crowdsale contracts have been designed to be combined, just read the source code of the base Crowdsale contract for directions on how to extend it**. For the crowdsale of our token, we need to mint tokens when the ether is received by the crowdsale contract, so let’s use [MintedCrowdsale](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/emission/MintedCrowdsale.sol) as a base. And to make it more interesting, let’s make it also a [PostDeliveryCrowdsale](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/distribution/PostDeliveryCrowdsale.sol) so the tokens can only be withdrawn after the crowdsale ends. Write the following into `contracts/SampleCrowdsale.sol`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "pragma solidity 0.4.23;\n",
    "\n",
    "import './SampleToken.sol';\n",
    "import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/crowdsale/emission/MintedCrowdsale.sol';\n",
    "import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/crowdsale/distribution/PostDeliveryCrowdsale.sol';\n",
    "\n",
    "contract SampleCrowdsale is PostDeliveryCrowdsale, MintedCrowdsale {\n",
    "\n",
    "  constructor(\n",
    "    uint256 _openingTime,\n",
    "    uint256 _closingTime\n",
    "    uint256 _rate,\n",
    "    address _wallet,\n",
    "    MintableToken _token\n",
    "  )\n",
    "    public\n",
    "    Crowdsale(_rate, _wallet, _token)\n",
    "    PostDeliveryCrowdsale(_openingTime, _closingTime)\n",
    "  {\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we almost didn’t have to write any code, but just to reuse the already battle-tested code that the OpenZeppelin community made available for us. However, **it is important to note that this case is different than the one of our SampleToken contract. If you go to the Crowdsale automated tests you will see that they are tested in isolation. When you integrate different units of code into a bigger component, it’s not enough to test all the units separately because the interactions between them might cause behaviors that you didn’t expect**. In particular, you will see that here we introduced multiple inheritance, which can surprise the developer if they don’t understand the implementation details of the Solidity compiler. Our SampleCrowdsale is simple, and it will work just as we expect because the framework was designed to make cases like these straightforward; but do not relax your security because of the simplicity that this framework introduces. **Every time you integrate parts of the OpenZeppelin framework to build a more complex solution, you must fully test every aspect of your solution to ensure that all the interactions of the units work as you intend.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after we are happy with our solution and we have tested it thoroughly, we need to deploy it. **OpenZeppelin integrates well with Truffle, so we can just write a migrations file as explained in the Truffle section above**. Write the following in ``migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js``:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const SampleCrowdsale = artifacts.require('./SampleCrowdsale.sol');\n",
    "const SampleToken = artifacts.require('./SampleToken.sol');\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = function(deployer, network, accounts) {\n",
    "  const openingTime = web3.eth.getBlock('latest').timestamp + 2; // two secs in the future\n",
    "  const closingTime = openingTime + 86400 * 20; // 20 days\n",
    "  const rate = new web3.BigNumber(1000);\n",
    "  const wallet = accounts[1];\n",
    "\n",
    "  return deployer\n",
    "    .then(() => {\n",
    "      return deployer.deploy(SampleToken);\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .then(() => {\n",
    "      return deployer.deploy(\n",
    "        SampleCrowdsale,\n",
    "        openingTime,\n",
    "        closingTime,\n",
    "        rate,\n",
    "        wallet,\n",
    "        SampleToken.address\n",
    "      );\n",
    "    });\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "This was just a quick overview of a few of the contracts that are part of the OpenZeppelin framework. **There are many more, and the community is always proposing ideas for new ones, implementing new strategies to make them safer, simpler and clearer, and trying to find holes early to prevent vulnerabilities on the mainnet contracts**.

    "#### zeppelin_os\n",
    "\n",
    "[zeppelin_os](https://github.com/zeppelinos) **is an open-source, distributed platform of tools and services on top of the EVM to develop and manage smart contract applications securely.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unlike OpenZeppelin’s code, which needs to be re-deployed with each application every time, zeppelin_os’s code lives on-chain. Applications that need a given functionality, say, an ERC20 token, not only do not have to re-design and re-audit its implementation (something that OpenZeppelin solved) but do not even need to deploy it. With zeppelin_os, an application interacts with the token’s on-chain implementation directly, in much the same way as a desktop application interacts with the components of its underlying OS.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications that make use of OpenZeppelin avoid having to \"reinvent the wheel\" by reusing the library’s curated and peer reviewed contracts. However, every single time an application uses an ERC20 token implementation, the same ERC20 bytecode is deployed into the blockchain, over and over again**. Such bytecode exists duplicated in the network countless times. **Now, applications that make use of zeppelin_os avoid this unnecessary duplication. Instead of deploying their own ERC20 implementation, they link to a contract that defines the latest ERC20 implementation accepted by the community**. This single, central implementation is deployed in the blockchain only once, much like Solidity’s libraries, but are considerably more sophisticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unlike Solidity’s libraries, the implementations offered by zeppelin_os can be treated like regular contracts, i.e. they have storage. Also, they are upgradeable**. If a vulnerability is ever found in one of the OS’s official implementations, it can simply be swapped with an upgraded one. **In the case of the ERC20 token, an upgrade to its implementation would instantly ripple to all the applications that use it. The OS not only provides upgradeability for all of its implementations, but also for the user’s own contracts, and even for it’s own codebase! Developers decide when and how an application should implement an upgrade, and even which \"flavor\" of an implementation to adhere to.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the core of zeppelin_os sits a very clever contract known as a \"proxy\". A proxy is a contract that is capable of wrapping any other contract, exposing its interface without having to manually implement setters and getters for it, and can upgrade it without losing state**. In Solidity terms, it can be seen as a normal contract whose business logic is contained within a library, which can be swapped by a new library at any time without losing its state. The way in which the proxy links to its implementation is completely automated and encapsulated for the developer. Practically any contract can be made upgradeable with little to no change in its code. More about zeppelin_os’s proxy mechanism can be found in Zeppelin’s blog: [upgradeability-using-unstructured-storage](https://blog.zeppelinos.org/), and an example of how to use it can be found here: https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos-lib/tree/master/examples/single.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The OS wraps its implementations in packages or \"releases\" that can be vouched for using ZepTokens. ZepTokens can hence be staked against a release, signaling it as the community’s accepted implementation set**. Anyone can submit new releases that can be scrutinized by the community and eventually accepted as official. As a reward, developers of a release receive tokens each time it is vouched for. **As a Dapp developer, vouching provides a measurable way to determine how much is staked for a given release, and hence how much it can be trusted.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Developing applications using zeppelin_os is similar to developing Javascript applications using NPM**. An AppManager handles an application package for each version of the application. A package is simply a directory of contracts, each of which can have one or more upgradeable proxies. The AppManager does not only provide proxies for application-specific contracts, but does so also for zeppelin_os implementations in the form of a standard library. To see a full example of this, please visit: [examples/complex](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos-lib/tree/master/). \n",
    "\n",
    "//// TODO: the example provided above is still a WIP - link to a tutorial once it’s finished\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although currently in development, zeppelin_os aims to provide a wide set of additional features, such as developer tools, a scheduler that automates background operations within contracts, development bounties, a marketplace that facilitates communication and exchange of value between applications and much more.** All of this is described in zeppelin_os’s [whitepaper](https://zeppelinos.org/zeppelin_os_).\n",

    "# Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are tokens?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The word token derives from the Old English \"tacen\" meaning a sign or symbol**. Commonly used to mean privately-issued coin-like items that have insignificant value, as used in transportation tokens, laundry tokens, arcade tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nowadays, \"tokens\" administered on blockchains are redefining the word to mean blockchain-based abstractions that can be owned and that represent assets, currency, or access rights.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The association between the word \"token\" and insignificant value has a lot to do with the limited use of the physical versions of tokens. **Often restricted to specific businesses, organizations or locations, physical tokens are not easily exchangeable and cannot be used for more than one function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**With blockchain tokens, these restrictions are erased, or more accurately, completely redefinable. Many of these blockchain tokens serve multiple purposes globally and can be traded for each other or for other currencies in global liquid markets**. <u>With the restrictions on use and ownership gone, the \"insignificant value\" expectation is also a thing of the past.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we look at various uses for tokens and how they are created. We also discuss attributes of tokens such as fungibility and intrinsicality. Finally, we examine the standards and technologies that they are based on an experiment by building our own tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How are tokens used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious use of tokens is as digital private currencies. However, this is only one possible use. Tokens can be programmed to serve many different functions, often overlapping. For example, **a token can simultaneously convey a voting right, an access right, and ownership of a resource. Currency is just the first \"app\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Currency**<br>\n",
    "A token can serve as a form of currency, with a value determined through private trade.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource**<br>\n",
    "A token can represent a resource earned or produced in a sharing-economy or resource-sharing environment. For example, a storage or CPU token representing resources that can be shared over a network.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asset**<br>\n",
    "A token can represent ownership of an intrinsic or extrinsic, tangible or intangible asset. For example, gold, real-estate, a car, oil, energy, MMOG items, etc.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access**<br>\n",
    "A token can represent access rights and even convey access to a digital or physical property, such as a discussion forum, an exclusive website, a hotel room, a rental car, etc.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equity**<br>\n",
    "A token can represent shareholder equity in a digital organization (e.g. a DAO) or legal fiction (e.g. a corporation).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voting**<br>\n",
    "A token can represent voting rights in a digital or legal system.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collectible**<br>\n",

    "A token can represent a digital identity (e.g. avatar) or legal identity (e.g. national ID).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attestation**<br>\n",
    "A token can represent a certification or attestation of fact by some authority or by a decentralized reputation system (e.g. marriage record, birth certificate, college degree).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Utility**\n",
    "A token can be used to access or pay for a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Often, a single token encompasses several of these functions**. Sometimes it is hard to discern between them, as the physical equivalents have always been inextricably linked. For example, in the physical world, a driver’s license (attestation) is also an identity document (identity) and the two cannot be separated. In the digital realm, previously commingled functions can be separated and developed independently (e.g. an anonymous attestation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokens and fungibility\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia: **In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokens are fungible when we can substitute any single unit of the token for another without any difference in its value or function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, if a token’s historical provenance can be tracked, then it is not entirely fungible. The ability to track provenance can lead to blacklisting and whitelisting, reducing or eliminating fungibility. We will examine this further in privacy section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-fungible tokens are tokens that each represent a unique tangible or intangible item and therefore are not interchangeable.** For example, a token that represents ownership of a specific Van Gogh painting is not equivalent to another token that represents a Picasso, even though they might be part of the same \"art ownership token\" system. Similarly, **a token representing a specific digital collectible such as a specific CryptoKitty is not interchangeable with any other CryptoKitty. Each non-fungible token is associated with an unique identifier, such as a serial number.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see examples of both fungible and non-fungible tokens later in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counterparty risk\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party in a transaction will fail to meet their obligations. Some types of transactions create additional counterparty risks because of the addition of more than two parties in the transaction**. For example, if you hold a certificate of deposit for a precious metal and you sell that to someone, there are at least 3 parties in that transaction: the seller, the buyer and the custodian of the precious metal. Someone holds the physical asset and by necessity they become party to the fulfillment of the transaction and add counterparty risk to any transaction involving that asset. When an asset is traded indirectly through the exchange of a token of ownership, there is additional counterparty risk from the custodian of the asset. Do they have the asset? Will they recognize (or allow) the transfer of ownership based on the transfer of a token (such as a certificate, deed, title or digital token)? In the world of digital tokens representing assets, as in the non-digital world, it is important to understand who holds the asset that is represented by the token and what rules apply to that underlying asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokens and intrinsicality\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"intrinsic\" derives from the Latin \"intra\", meaning \"from within\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some tokens represent digital items that are intrinsic to the blockchain. Those digital assets are governed by consensus rules, just like the tokens themselves. This has an important implication: tokens that represent intrinsic assets do not carry additional counterparty risk**. If you hold the keys for a CryptoKitty, there is no other party holding that CryptoKitty for you - you own it directly. The blockchain consensus rules apply and your ownership (i.e. control) of the private keys is equivalent to ownership of the asset, without any intermediary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, many tokens are used to represent extrinsic things, like real-estate, corporate voting shares, trademarks, gold bars, etc. **The ownership of these extrinsic items, which are not \"within\" the blockchain, is governed by law, custom and policy that are separate from the consensus rules that govern the token. In other words, token issuers and owners may still depend on real world non-smart contracts**. As a result, these extrinsic assets carry additional counterparty risk because they are held by custodians, recorded in external registries, or controlled by laws and policies outside the blockchain environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the most important ramifications of blockchain-based tokens is the ability to convert extrinsic assets into intrinsic assets and thereby remove counterparty risk**. A good example is moving from equity in a corporation (extrinsic) to an equity or voting token in a decentralized autonomous organization or similar (intrinsic) organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using tokens: utility or equity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Almost all projects in Ethereum today are launching with some kind of token. But do all these projects really need a token?** Are there any disadvantages to using a token, or will we see the slogan \"tokenize all the things\" come to fruition? In principle, the use of tokens can be seen as the ultimate management or organization tool, which brings full flexibility to the subject at hand. In practice, the integration of blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, into the existing structures of society mean that, so far, there are many limitations to their applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First, let’s start by clarifying the role of a token in a new project. The majority of projects are using tokens in one of two ways**: either as \"**utility tokens**\" or as \"**equity tokens**\". Very often, those two roles are conflated and difficult to distinguish.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Utility Tokens**:<br>\n",
    "Utility tokens are those where the use of the token is required to gain access to a service, application or resource. Examples of utility tokens include tokens that represent resources such as shared storage, access to services such as social media networks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equity Tokens**:<br>\n",
    "Equity tokens are those that represent shares in the control or ownership of something, such as a startup. Equity tokens can be as limited as non-voting shares for distribution of dividends and profits, or as expansive as voting shares in a decentralized autonomous organization, where management of the platform is through some complex governance system based on votes by the token holders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It’s not a duck\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because a token is used to fundraise for a startup, doesn’t mean it has to be used as payment for the service, and vice-versa. **Many startups, however, face a difficult problem: tokens are a great fundraising mechanism, but offering securities (equity) to the public is a regulated activity in most jurisdictions. By disguising equity tokens as utility tokens, many startups hope to get around these regulatory restrictions and raise money from a public offering while presenting it as a pre-sale of \"service access vouchers\" or, as we call them, utility tokens**. Whether these thinly disguised equity offerings will be able to skirt the regulators remains to be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the popular saying goes: \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck - it’s a duck\". Regulators are not likely to be distracted by these semantic contortions; quite the opposite, they are more likely to see such legal sophistry as an attempt to deceive the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utility tokens: who needs them?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The real problem is that utility tokens introduce significant risks and adoption barriers for startups. Perhaps in a distant future \"tokenize all the things\" becomes a reality, but, at present, the number of people who have access to an understanding of and desire to use a token is a subset of the already small cryptocurrency market.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a startup, each innovation represents a risk and a market filter. Innovation is taking the road least traveled, walking away from the path of tradition. It is already a lonely walk. **If a startup is trying to innovate in a new area of technology, such as storage sharing over P2P networks, that is a lonely enough path. Adding a utility token to that innovation and requiring users to adopt tokens in order to use the service compounds the risk and increases the barriers to adoption**. It’s walking off the already lonely trail of P2P storage innovation and into the wilderness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of each innovation as a filter. It limits adoption to the subset of the market that can become early adopters of this innovation**. Adding a second filter compounds that effect, further limiting the addressable market. You are asking your early adopters to adopt not one but two completely new technologies: the novel application/platform/service you built, and the token economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a startup, each innovation introduces risks that increase the chance of failure of the startup. If you take your already risky startup idea and add a utility token, you are adding all the risks of the underlying platform (Ethereum), broader economy (exchanges, liquidity), regulatory environment (equity/commodity regulators) and technology (smart contracts, token standards). That’s a lot of risk for a startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advocates of \"tokenize all the things\" will likely counter that by adopting tokens they are also inheriting the market enthusiasm, early adopters, technology, innovation and liquidity of the entire token economy. That is true too. The question is whether the benefits and enthusiasm outweigh the risks and uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nevertheless, some of the most innovative business ideas are indeed taking place in the crypto realm**. If regulators are not quick enough to adopt laws and support new business models, talents and entrepreneurs will seek to operate in other jurisdictions which are more crypto-friendly. This is actually happening right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, at the beginning of this section, when introducing tokens we discussed the colloquial meaning of 'token' as \"something of insignificant value\". The underlying reason for the insignificant value of most tokens is because they can only be used in a very narrow context: one bus company, one laundromat, one arcade, one hotel, or one company store. Limited liquidity, limited applicability, and high conversion costs reduce the value of tokens all the way down until it is only of \"token\" value. **So when you add a utility token to your platform, but the token can only be used on your own one platform with a small market, you are re-creating the conditions that made physical tokens worthless, which may indeed be the correct way to incorporate tokenization into your project.** However, if in order to use your platform a user has to convert something into your utility token, use it and then convert the remainder back into something more generally useful, you’ve created a company script. The switching costs of a digital token are orders of magnitude lower than a physical token without a market, but the switching costs are not zero. **Utility tokens that work across an entire industry sector will be very interesting and probably quite valuable.** But if you set up your startup to have to bootstrap an entire industry standard in order to succeed, you may have already failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of deploying services on general-purpose platforms like Ethereum is exactly being able to connect smart contracts (and therefore the utility of tokens) across projects, increasing the potential for liquidity and utility of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make this decision for the right reasons. \n",
    "- Adopt a token because your application cannot work without a token. Adopt it because the token solves a fundamental market barrier or access problem. \n",
    "- Don’t introduce a utility token because it is the only way you can raise money fast and you need to pretend it’s not a public securities offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokens on Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blockchain tokens have existed before Ethereum.** In some ways, the first blockchain currency, bitcoin, is a token itself. Many token platforms were also developed on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies before Ethereum. **However, the introduction of the first token standard on Ethereum led to an explosion of tokens.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vitalik Buterin suggested tokens as one of the most obvious and useful applications of a generalized programmable blockchain such as Ethereum**. In fact, in the first year of Ethereum, it was common to see Vitalik and others wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the Ethereum logo and a smart contract sample on the back. There were several variations of this t-shirt, but the most common showed an implementation of a token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve into the details of creating tokens on Ethereum it is first important to look at an overview of how tokens work on Ethereum. **Tokens are different from ether because the Ethereum protocol does not know anything about them. Sending ether is an intrinsic action of the Ethereum platform, but sending or even owning tokens is not**. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**The ether balance of Ethereum accounts is handled at the protocol level, whereas the token balance of Ethereum accounts is handled at the smart contract level**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In order to create a new token on Ethereum, you must create a new smart contract. Once deployed, the smart contract handles everything, including ownership, transfers and access rights**. You can write your smart contract to perform all the necessary actions any way you want, but it is probably wisest to follow an existing standard. We will look at such standards next. We discuss the pros and cons of following standards at the end of the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ERC20 Token Standard\n",
    "\n",
    "The first standard was introduced in November 2015 by Fabian Vogelsteller, as an **Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC). It was automatically assigned GitHub issue number 20, giving rise to the name \"ERC20 token\"**. The vast majority of tokens are currently based on the ERC20 standard. **The ERC20 request for comments eventually became Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP20 but it is mostly still referred to by the original name ERC20.** You can read the standard here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md\n",
    "\n",
    "**ERC20 is a standard for fungible tokens** meaning that different units of an ERC20 token are interchangeable and have no unique properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The ERC20 standard defines a common interface for contracts implementing a token, such that any compatible token can be accessed and used in the same way.** The interface consists of a number of functions that must be present in every implementation of the standard, as well as some optional functions and attributes that may be added by developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ERC20 required functions & events\n",
    "\n",
    "An ERC20 compliant token contract must provide at least the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **totalSupply**<br>\n",
    "Returns the total units of this token that currently exist. ERC20 tokens can have a fixed or a variable supply.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **balanceOf**<br>\n",
    "Given an address, returns the token balance of that address.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **transfer**<br>\n",
    "Given an address and amount, transfers that amount of tokens to that address, from the balance of the address that executed the transfer.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **transferFrom**<br>\n",
    "Given a sender, recipient and amount, transfers tokens from one account to another. Used in combination with approve below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **approve**<br>\n",
    "Given a recipient address and amount, authorizes that address to execute several transfers up to that amount, from the account that issued the approval.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **allowance**<br>\n",
    "Given an owner address and a spender address, returns the remaining amount that the spender is approved to withdraw from the owner.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transfer event**<br>\n",
    "Event triggered upon successful transfer (call to transfer or transferFrom) (even for zero value transfers).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approval event**<br>\n",
    "Event logged upon a successful call to approve.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ERC20 optional functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the required functions listed above, the follow optional functions are also defined by the standard:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **name**<br>\n",
    "Returns a human readable name (e.g. \"US Dollars\") of the token.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **symbol**<br>\n",
    "Returns a human readable symbol (e.g. \"USD\") for the token.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **decimals**<br>\n",
    "Returns the number of decimals used to divide token amounts. For example, if decimals is 2, then the token amount is divided by 100 to get its user representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The ERC20 interface defined in Solidity\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what an ERC20 interface specification looks like in Solidity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "contract ERC20 {\n",
    "   function totalSupply() constant returns (uint theTotalSupply);\n",
    "   function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);\n",
    "   function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);\n",
    "   function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);\n",
    "   function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);\n",
    "   function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining);\n",
    "   event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);\n",
    "   event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ERC20 data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you examine any ERC20 implementation, it will contain two data structures, one to track balances and one to track allowances. In Solidity, they are implemented with a data mapping.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first data mapping implements an internal table of token balances, by owner. This allows the token contract to keep track of who owns the tokens. Each transfer is a deduction from one balance and an addition to another balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balances: a mapping from address (owner) to amount (balance)<br>\n",
    "```mapping(address => uint256) balances;```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second data structure is a data mapping of allowances. As we will see in ERC20 workflows: \"transfer\" and \"approve & transferFrom\", with ERC20 tokens an owner of a token can delegate authority to a spender, allowing them to spend a specific amount (allowance) from the owner’s balance. The ERC20 contract keeps track of the allowances with a two-dimensional mapping, with the primary key being the address of the token owner, mapping to a spender address and an allowance amount:\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowances: a mapping from address (owner) to address (spender) to amount (allowance)<br>\n",
    "```mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowed;```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ERC20 workflows: \"transfer\" and \"approve & transferFrom\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERC20 token standard has two transfer functions. You might be wondering why?\n",
    "\n",
    "ERC20 allows for two different workflows. **The first is a single-transaction, straightforward workflow using the transfer function. This workflow is the one used by wallets to send tokens to other wallets**. The vast majority of token transactions happen with the transfer workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing the transfer contract is very simple. If Alice wants to send 10 tokens to Bob, her wallet sends a transaction to the token contract’s address, calling the transfer function with Bob’s address and \"10\" as the arguments. The token contract adjusts Alice’s balance (-10) and Bob’s balance (10) and issues a +Transfer event.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The second workflow is a two-transaction workflow that uses approve, followed by transferFrom. This workflow allows a token owner to delegate their control to another address. It is most often used to delegate control to a contract for distribution of tokens, but it can also be used by exchanges**. For example, if a company is selling tokens for an \"Initial Coin Offering\", they can approve a crowdsale contract address to distribute a certain amount of tokens. The crowdsale contract can then transferFrom the token contract owner balance to each buyer of the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/approve_transferFrom_workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the approve & transferFrom workflow, two transactions are needed. Let’s say that Alice wants to allow the AliceICO contract to sell 50% of all the AliceCoin tokens to buyers like Bob and Charlie. First, Alice launches the AliceCoin ERC20 contract, issuing all the AliceCoin to her own address. Then, Alice launches the AliceICO contract that can sell tokens for ether. Next, Alice initiates the approve & transferFrom workflow. She sends a transaction to the AliceCoin contract, calling approve, with the address of the AliceICO contract and 50% of the totalSupply as arguments. This will trigger the Approval event. Now, the AliceICO contract can sell AliceCoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the AliceICO contract receives ether from Bob, it needs to send some AliceCoin to Bob in return. Within the AliceICO contract is an exchange rate between AliceCoin and ether. The exchange rate that Alice set when she created the AliceICO contract determines how many tokens Bob will receive for the amount of ether sent to the AliceICO contract. When the AliceICO contract calls the AliceCoin transferFrom function, it sets Alice’s address as the sender, Bob’s address as the recipient, and uses the exchange rate to determine how many AliceCoin tokens will be transferred to Bob in the \"value\" field. The AliceCoin contract transfers the balance from Alice’s address to Bob’s address and triggers a Transfer event. The AliceICO contract can call transferFrom an unlimited number of times, as long as it doesn’t exceed the approval limit Alice set. The AliceICO contract can keep track of how many AliceCoin tokens it can sell by calling the allowance function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ERC20 Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "**While it is possible to implement an ERC20-compatible token in about thirty lines of Solidity code, most implementations are more complex. This is to account for potential security vulnerabilities.** There are two implementations mentioned in the EIP20 standard:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consensys EIP20**<br>\n",
    "A simple and easy to read implementation of an ERC20-compatible token.<br><br>\n",
    "You can read the Solidity code for Consensys' implementation here: https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/contracts/eip20/EIP20.sol<br><br>\n",
    "- **OpenZeppelin StandardToken**<br>\n",
    "This implementation is ERC20-compatible, with additional security precautions. It forms the basis of OpenZeppelin libraries implementing more complex ERC20-compatible tokens with fundraising caps, auctions, vesting schedules and other features.<br><br>\n",
    "You can see the Solidity code for OpenZeppelin StandardToken here: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Launching our own ERC20 token\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create and launch our own token. For this example, we will use the truffle framework. The example assumes you have already installed truffle, configured it, and are familiar with its basic operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call our token \"Mastering Ethereum Token\", with symbol \"MET\".\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, we have transferred 1000 MET to the Faucet contract. Now, how do we withdraw from the Faucet?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, Faucet.sol is a pretty simple contract. It only has one function, withdraw, which is for withdrawing ether. It doesn’t have a function for withdrawing MET, or any other ERC20 token. If we use withdraw it will try to send ether, but since the faucet doesn’t have a balance of ether yet, it will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The METoken contract knows that Faucet has a balance, but the only way that it can transfer that balance is if it receives a transfer call from the address of the contract. Somehow we need to make the Faucet contract call the transfer function in METoken.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you’re wondering what to do next, don’t. There is no solution to this problem. The MET sent to Faucet is stuck, forever. Only the Faucet contract can transfer it, and the Faucet contract doesn’t have code to call the transfer function of an ERC20 token contract.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you anticipated this problem. Most likely, you didn’t. In fact, neither did hundreds of Ethereum users who accidentally transferred various tokens to contracts that didn’t have any ERC20 capability. According to some estimates, tokens worth more than roughly 2.5 million USD (at the time of writing) have been \"stuck\" like this and are lost forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the ways that users of ERC20 tokens can inadvertently lose their tokens in a transfer, is when they attempt to transfer to an exchange or another service. They copy an Ethereum address from the website of an exchange, thinking they can simply send tokens to it. However, many exchanges publish receiving addresses that are actually contracts! These contracts serve a number of different functions, most often sweeping all funds sent to them to \"cold storage\" or another centralized wallet.** Despite the many warnings saying \"do not send tokens to this address\", lots of tokens are lost this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demonstrating the approve & transferFrom workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Faucet contract couldn’t handle ERC20 tokens. Sending tokens to it, using the transfer function results in the loss of those tokens. Let’s rewrite the contract and make it handle ERC20 tokens. Specifically, we will turn it into a faucet that gives out MET to anyone who asks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we make a copy of the truffle project directory, call it METoken_METFaucet, initialize truffle, npm, install OpenZeppelin dependencies and copy the METoken.sol contract. See our first example Launching our own ERC20 token for the detailed instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s create a new faucet contract, call it METFaucet.sol. It will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for\n",
    "pragma solidity ^0.4.19;\n",
    "\n",
    "import 'zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol';\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "// A faucet for ERC20 token MET\n",
    "contract METFaucet {\n",
    "\n",
    "\tStandardToken public METoken;\n",
    "\taddress public METOwner;\n",
    "\n",
    "\t// METFaucet constructor, provide the address of METoken contract and\n",
    "\t// the owner address we will be approved to transferFrom\n",
    "\tfunction METFaucet(address _METoken, address _METOwner) public {\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t// Initialize the METoken from the address provided\n",
    "\t\tMEToken = StandardToken(_METoken);\n",
    "\t\tMETOwner = _METOwner;\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\n",
    "\tfunction withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {\n",
    "\n",
    "    \t// Limit withdrawal amount to 10 MET\n",
    "    \trequire(withdraw_amount <= 1000);\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t// Use the transferFrom function of METoken\n",
    "\t\tMEToken.transferFrom(METOwner, msg.sender, withdraw_amount);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "\t// REJECT any incoming ether\n",
    "\tfunction () public payable { revert(); }\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve made quite a few changes to the basic faucet example. Since METFaucet will use the transferFrom function in METoken, it will need two additional variables. One will hold the address of the deployed METoken contract. The other will hold the address of the owner of MET who will provide approval the faucet withdrawals. The METFaucet will call METoken.transferFrom and instruct it to move MET from the owner to the address where the faucet withdrawal request came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "We declare these two variables here:\n",
    "```\n",
    "StandardToken public METoken;\n",
    "address public METOwner;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our faucet needs to be initialized with the correct addresses for METoken and METOwner we need to declare a custom constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// METFaucet constructor, provide the address of METoken contract and\n",
    "// the owner address we will be approved to transferFrom\n",
    "function METFaucet(address _METoken, address _METOwner) public {\n",
    "\n",
    "\t// Initialize the METoken from the address provided\n",
    "\tMEToken = StandardToken(_METoken);\n",
    "\tMETOwner = _METOwner;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next change is to the withdraw function. Instead of calling transfer, METFaucet uses the transferFrom function in METoken and asks METoken to transfer MET to the faucet recipient:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Use the transferFrom function of METoken\n",
    "METoken.transferFrom(METOwner, msg.sender, withdraw_amount);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since our faucet no longer sends ether, we should probably prevent anyone from sending ether to METFaucet, as we wouldn’t want it to get stuck. We change the fallback payable function to reject incoming ether, using the revert function to revert any incoming payments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// REJECT any incoming ether\n",
    "function () public payable { revert(); }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our METFaucet.sol code is ready, we need to modify the migration script to deploy it. This migration script will be a bit more complex, as METFaucet depends on the address of METoken. We will use a JavaScript promise to deploy the two contracts in sequence. Create 2_deploy_contracts.js as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var METoken = artifacts.require(\"METoken\");\n",
    "var METFaucet = artifacts.require(\"METFaucet\");\n",
    "var owner = web3.eth.accounts[0];\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = function(deployer) {\n",
    "\n",
    "\t// Deploy the METoken contract first\n",
    "\tdeployer.deploy(METoken, {from: owner}).then(function() {\n",
    "\t\t// then deploy METFaucet and pass the address of METoken\n",
    "\t\t// and the address of the owner of all the MET who will approve METFaucet\n",
    "\t\treturn deployer.deploy(METFaucet, METoken.address, owner);\n",
    "  \t});\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, we can test everything in the truffle console. First, we use migrate to deploy the contracts. When METoken is deployed it will allocate all the MET to the account that created it, web3.eth.accounts[0]. Then, we call the approve function in METoken to approve METFaucet to send up to 1000 MET on behalf of web3.eth.accounts[0]. Finally, to test our faucet, we call METFaucet.withdraw from web3.eth.accounts[1] and try to withdraw 10 MET. Here are the console commands:\n",

    "\n",
    "> However, the burden of managing ERC20 tokens correctly is pushed to the user interface. **If a user incorrectly attempts to transfer ERC20 tokens to a contract address and that contract is not equipped to receive ERC20 tokens, the tokens will be lost.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issues with ERC20 tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**The adoption of the ERC20 token standard has been truly explosive. Thousands of tokens have been launched, both to experiment with new capabilities and to raise funds in various \"crowdfund\" auctions and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)**. However there are some potential pitfalls, as we saw with the issue of transferring tokens to contract addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the less obvious issues with ERC20 tokens is that they expose subtle differences between tokens and ether itself. Where ether is transferred by a transaction which has a recipient address as its destination, token transfers occur within the specific token contract state and have the token contract as their destination, not the recipient’s address**. The token contract tracks balances and issues events. In a token transfer, no transaction is actually sent to the recipient of the token. Instead, the recipient’s address is added to a map within the token contract itself. A transaction sending ether to an address changes the state of an address. **A transaction transferring a token to an address only changes the state of the token contract, not the state of the recipient address. Even a wallet that has support for ERC20 tokens does not become aware of a token balance unless the user explicitly adds a specific token contract to \"watch\"**. Some wallets watch the most popular token contracts to detect balances held by addresses they control, but that’s limited to a small fraction of the available ERC20 contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it’s unlikely that a user would want to track all balances in all possible ERC20 token contracts. **Many ERC20 tokens are more like email spam than usable tokens. They automatically create balances for accounts that have ether activity, in order to attract users**. If you have an Ethereum address with a long history of activity, especially if it was created in the presale, you will find it full of \"junk\" tokens that appeared out of nowhere. **Of course, the address isn’t really full of tokens, it’s the token contracts that have your address in them. You only see these balances if these tokens contracts are being watched by the block explorer or wallet you use to view your address.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens don’t behave the same way as ether. Ether is sent with the send function and accepted by any payable function in a contract or any externally owned address. **Tokens are sent using transfer or approve & transferFrom functions that exist only in the ERC20 contract, and do not (at least in ERC20) trigger any payable functions in a recipient contract.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tokens are meant to function just like a cryptocurrency such as ether, **but they come with certain subtle distinctions that break that illusion.**\n",

    "Consider another issue. **To send ether, or use any Ethereum contract you need ether to pay gas. To send tokens, you also need ether. You cannot pay for a transaction’s gas with a token and the token contract can’t pay the gas for you.** This may change at some point in the distant future, but for the foreseeable this can cause some rather strange user experiences. For example, let’s say you use an exchange or Shapeshift to convert some bitcoin to a token. You \"receive\" the token in a wallet that tracks that token’s contract and shows your balance. It looks the same as any of the other cryptocurrencies you have in your wallet. Now try sending the token and your wallet will inform you that you need ether to do that. You might be confused - after all you didn’t need ether to receive the token. Perhaps you have no ether. Perhaps you didn’t even know the token was an ERC20 token on Ethereum, maybe you thought it was a cryptocurrency with its own blockchain. The illusion just broke.\n",

    "**Some of these issues are specific to ERC20 tokens. Others are more general issues that relate to abstraction and interface boundaries within Ethereum**. Some can be solved by changing the token interface, others may need changes to fundamental structures within Ethereum (such as the distinction between EOAs and contracts, and between transactions and messages). Some may not be \"solvable\" exactly and may require user interface design to hide the nuances and make the user experience consistent regardless of the underlying distinctions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The ERC223 proposal attempts to solve the problem of inadvertent transfer of tokens to a contract (that may or may not support tokens) by detecting whether the destination address is a contract or not**. ERC223 requires that contracts designed to accept tokens implement a function named tokenFallback. If the destination of a transfer is a contract and the contract does not have support for tokens (i.e. does not implement tokenFallback), the transfer fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect whether the destination address is a contract, the ERC223 reference implementation uses a small segment of inline bytecode, in a rather creative way:\n",

    "interface ERC777TokensRecipient {\n",
    "    function tokensReceived(address operator, address from, address to, uint amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData) public;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The implementation of this interface is required for any address wishing to be notified of, to handle, or to reject the reception of tokens**. The same logic and requirements as the tokens sender interface apply to the tokens recipient with the added constraint that recipient contracts must implement this interface to prevent locking tokens. If the recipient contract does not register an address implementing this interface, the transfer of tokens will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An important aspect is that only one single tokens sender and one tokens recipient can be registered per address. Hence the same hook functions are called upon the debit and the reception of every ERC777 token transfer**. A specific token can be identified in these functions using the message’s sender which is the specific token contract address, for example, to handle a particular use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the same tokens sender and tokens recipient hooks can be registered for multiple addresses and the hooks can distinguish who are the sender and the intended recipient using the from and to parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reference implementation of ERC777 is linked in the proposal. ERC777 depends on a parallel proposal for a registry contract, specified in ERC820. **Some of the debate on ERC777 is about the complexity of adopting two big changes at once: a new token standard and a registry standard**. The discussion continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Token standards\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ve reviewed several proposed standards and a couple of widely-deployed standards for token contracts. \n",
    "- What exactly do these standards do? \n",
    "- Should you use these standards? \n",
    "- How should you use them? \n",
    "- Should you add functionality beyond these standards? \n",
    "- Which standards should you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine all those questions next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are token standards? What is their purpose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Token standards are a minimum specification for an implementation. What that means is that in order to be compliant with, say ERC20, you need to at minimum implement the functions and behavior specified by ERC20. You are also free to add to the functionality by implementing functions that are not part of the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The primary purpose of these standards is to encourage interoperability between contracts. Thus, all wallets, exchanges, user interfaces and other infrastructure components can interface in a predictable manner with any contract that follows the specification.** I.e. if you deploy a contract that follows the ERC20 standard, all existing wallet users can seamlessly start trading your token without any wallet upgrade or effort on your part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standards are meant to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive. How you choose to implement those functions is up to you - the internal function of the contract is not relevant to the standard. They have some functional requirements, which govern the behavior under specific circumstances, but they do not prescribe an implementation. An example of this is the behavior of a transfer function if the value is set to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Should you use these standards?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all these standards, **each developer faces a dilemma: use the existing standards or innovate beyond the restrictions they impose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dilemma is not easy to resolve. **Standards necessarily restrict your ability to innovate, by creating a narrow \"rut\" that you have to follow. On the other hand, the basic standards have emerged from the experience with hundreds of applications and often fit well with 99% of the use-cases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this consideration is an even bigger issue: **\"the value of interoperability and broad adoption\". If you choose to use an existing standard, you gain the value of all the systems designed to work with that standard. If you choose to depart from the standard, you have to consider the cost of building all of the support infrastructure on your own, or persuading others to support your implementation as a new standard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tendency to forge your own path and ignore existing standards is known as \"**Not Invented Here**\" and is antithetical to the open source culture. **On the other hand, progress and innovation depends on departing from tradition sometimes. It’s a tricky choice, so consider it carefully!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia \"Not Invented Here\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Not invented here is a stance adopted by social, corporate, or institutional cultures that avoid using or buying already existing products, research, standards, or knowledge because of their external origins and costs, such as royalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security by maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the choice of standard, there is the parallel choice of implementation. When you decide to use a standard, such as ERC20, you have to then decide how to implement a compatible design. There are a number of existing \"reference\" implementations that are broadly used in the Ethereum ecosystem, or you could write your own from scratch. Again, this choice represents a dilemma that can have serious security implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Existing implementations are \"battle tested\". While it is impossible to prove that they are secure, many of them underpin millions of dollars of tokens. They have been attacked, repeatedly and vigorously. So far, no significant vulnerabilities have been discovered. Writing your own is not easy - there are many subtle ways that a contract can be compromised. It is much safer to use a well-tested broadly-used implementation.** In our examples above, we used the **OpenZeppelin implementation of the ERC20 standard**, as this implementation is security focused from the ground up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you use an existing implementation you can also extend it. Again, be careful with this impulse. Complexity is the enemy of security.**\n",
    "> Every single line of code you add expands the attack surface of your contract and could represent a vulnerability lying in wait. You may not notice a problem until you put a lot of value on top of the contract and someone breaks it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extensions to token interface standards\n",
    "\n",
    "The token standards discussed in this section start with a very minimal interface, with limited functionality. Many projects have created extended implementations to support features that they need for their application. Some of these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Owner Control**<br>\n",
    "Specific addresses, or sets of addresses (i.e. multi-sig) are given special capabilities, such as blacklisting, whitelisting, minting, recovery, etc.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Burning**<br>\n",
    "A token burn is when tokens are deliberately destroyed by transfer to an unspendable address or by erasing a balance and reducing the supply.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minting**\n",
    "The ability to add to the total supply of tokens, at a predictable rate, or by \"fiat\" of the creator of the token.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crowdfunding**<br>\n",
    "The ability to offer tokens for sale, for example through an auction, market sale, reverse-auction, etc.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Caps**<br>\n",
    "Pre-defined and immutable limits on the total supply, the opposite of the \"minting\" feature.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recovery \"Back Doors\"**<br>\n",
    "Functions to recover funds, reverse transfers, or dismantle the token that can be activated by a designated address or sets of addresses.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Whitelisting**<br>\n",
    "The ability to restrict actions (such as token transfers) only to listed addresses. Most commonly used to offer tokens to \"accredited investors\" after vetting by the rules of different jurisdictions. There is usually a mechanism for updating the whitelist.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blacklisting**<br>\n",
    "The ability to restrict token transfers by disallowing specific addresses. There is usually a function for updating the blacklist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are some reference implementations for many of these functions, for example in the OpenZeppelin library.** Some of these are use-case specific and only implemented in a few tokens. There are, as of now, no widely accepted standards for the interfaces to these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **As previously discussed, the decision to extend a token standard with additional functionality represents a tradeoff between innovation/risk and interoperability/security.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokens and ICOs\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens have become an explosive development in the Ethereum ecosystem. It is likely that they will be a very important, foundational component of all smart-contract platforms like Ethereum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nevertheless, the importance and future impact of these standards should not be confused with an endorsement of the current token offerings**. As in any early stage technology, the first wave of products and companies will almost all fail, and some will fail spectacularly. **Many of the tokens on offer in Ethereum today are barely disguised scams, pyramid schemes and money grabs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The trick is to separate the long-term vision and impact of this technology, which is likely to be huge, from the short term bubble of token ICOs, which is rife with fraud**. Both can be true at the same time. **The token standards and platform will survive the current token mania, and then they will likely change the world.**\n",

    "# Gas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas is Ethereum’s unit for measuring how much computational, memory and storage work that is required to perform an action or a set of actions on the Ethereum blockchain. Every operation performed by a transaction or contract costs a certain amount of gas; the number of gas units required is related to the type and number of computational steps that are being executed**. In contrast to Bitcoin transaction fees, which only take into account the size of a transaction in kilobytes (kB), **Ethereum transaction fees must account for every computational step that ends up being performed by transactions and smart contract code execution.** The higher the number of operations transaction execution performs, the higher the cost to run it to completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each operation requires a fixed amount of gas.** Some examples from the Ethereum yellow paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding two numbers costs 3 gas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculating a Keccak256 hash costs 30 gas + 6 more gas for every 256 bits of data being hashed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sending a transaction costs 21000 gas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas is a crucial component of Ethereum and serves a dual role**.\n",
    "- One, as a layer of abstraction between the price of Ethereum (with its volatility [liability to change rapidly and unpredictably, especially for the worse.]) and the reward to miners for the work they do. \n",
    "- Two, defense against denial of service attacks. In order to prevent accidental or malicious infinite loops or other computational wastage in the network, the initiator of each transaction is required to set a limit to the amount of computation they are willing to pay for. The gas system, therefore, disincentivizes attackers from sending malicious \"spam\" transactions, as they must pay proportionately for the computational, bandwidth, and storage resources that they consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Halting Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of transaction fees and accounting seems practical, **though you might wonder why Ethereum requires gas in the first place. Gas is pivotal, as it not only attends to the halting problem but is also critical for safety and liveness**. What is the halting problem, safety, and liveness, and why should you care?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paying for gas\n",
    "\n",
    "**While gas has a price, it cannot be \"owned\" nor \"spent\". Gas exists only inside the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a count of how much computational work is being performed. The sender is charged a transaction fee in ether, which is then converted to gas and then back to ether as block rewards for the miners**. \n",
    "> These conversion steps are in place to separate the price for the computation (tied to amount of processing) from the price of ether (tied to market fluctuations).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gas cost vs. gas price\n",
    "\n",
    "**While the gas cost is a measure of operational steps performed in the EVM, the gas itself also has a gas price measured in ether. When performing a transaction, the sender specifies the gas price they are willing to pay (in ether) for each unit of gas, allowing the market to decide the relationship between the price of ether and the cost of computing operations (as measured in gas).**\n",
    "\n",
    "```total gas used * gas price paid = transaction fee in ether```\n",
    "\n",
    "Miners on the Ethereum network can choose between pending transaction requests by, for example, selecting those which offer to pay a higher gas price. **It is currently the case that offering a higher gas price with your transaction will get your confirmed faster.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the similarity of names, it is important to be clear about the distinction between the **gas cost, being the number of units of gas to perform a particular operation**, e.g. transferring ether (21000 gas) or adding two numbers in a smart contract (3 gas), from **the gas price, which is the amount you are willing to pay per unit of gas (priced in ether)** when you send your transaction to the Ethereum network:\n",
    "\n",
    "**gas cost** - cost of an operation (in gas)\n",
    "\n",
    "**gas price** - the price of a unit of gas (in ether)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rational Behind Gas Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**The relative gas costs of the various operations that can be performed by the EVM have been carefully chosen to best protect the Ethereum blockchain from attack. More computationally intensive operations cost more gas**. For example, executing the SHA3 function is ten times more expensive (30 gas) than the ADD operation (3 gas). More importantly, some operations, such as EXP require payment for the operation and additional payment based on the size of the operand. **There is also a gas cost to using EVM memory and for storing data in a contract’s on-chain storage**. It is not ideal to conflate the different modalities of resource usage, but making execution cost a vector would have been too much work to allow a timely release of the Ethereum platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The initial set of gas costs was close to optimal, but someone found and exploited a mismatch in gas cost and real-world resource cost which made the Ethereum main-net almost grind to a halt until a hardfork tweaked the relative gas costs and fixed the problem**. Since then the blockchain has been running very well in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gas cost limit and running out of gas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before sending a transaction, senders must specify a gas limit - the maximum amount of gas they are willing to buy and use on executing their transaction. They must also specify the gas price - the price in ether they are willing to pay for each unit of gas.**\n",
    "\n",
    "`gas limit * gas price` **in ether is deducted from the sender’s account at the start of transaction execution as a deposit. This is to prevent the sender from going \"bankrupt\" mid-execution and being unable to pay for gas costs**. Any transaction that has set a gas limit such that this \"deposit\" exceeds the ether account balance will be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice, the sender will set a gas limit that is higher than or equal to the gas expected to be used. If the gas limit is set higher than the amount of gas consumed, the sender will receive a refund of the excess amount, as miners are only compensated for the work they actually perform.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In which case:\n",
    "`(gas limit - excess gas) * gas price` ether goes to the miner as a block reward\n",
    "\n",
    "`excess gas * gas price` ether is refunded to the sender\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, if the gas used exceeds the specified gas limit at any point, i.e. if the transaction \"runs of out gas\" during execution, the operation is immediately terminated. Although the transaction was unsuccessful, the sender will not get their transaction fee back as miners have already performed the computational work up to that point, and will be compensated for doing so.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the transaction is being sent from an Externally Owned Account (EOA), the ether to buy gas limit amount of gas at the offered gas price is deducted from the EOA’s balance.** In other words, the originator of the transaction is paying for the gas. The originator funds the total gas consumed by the transaction as well as any \"sub-executions\" that result. **This means that if the initiator X pays for gas to call contract A, which spends some of that gas on computation and then sends another message call to contract B, the gas used by A to execute the B is also deducted from X’s gas supply specified and paid for at the start.**\n",
    "```\n",
    "An EOA account X initiates a transaction which sends data to a contract account A, paying for a supply of 25000 gas for the whole transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the intrinsic cost of sending a transaction (which is 21000 gas) is deducted from the gas supply\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, Contract A is executed and spends 440 gas on computation and initiates a message call (which costs 700 gas) to Contract B\n",
    "\n",
    "Contract B spends 360 gas on computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning from Contract B completes the transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "2500 gas worth of ether (at the gas price for this transaction) gets refunded to X\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any intermediary contract that executes a portion of the operations in a transaction can therefore theoretically run out of gas if the originator of that transaction did not pay for a big enough supply of gas at the start. In cases where contracts run out of gas mid-execution, all state changes that would have otherwise resulted from that contract’s execution are ignored, except the caller still pays for all the gas used to execute code to get to that point** (as execution is the only way to determine that the computation will use up the gas supply).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating Gas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimating gas works by pretending the transaction was actually being included in the blockchain, and then returning the exact gas amount that would have been charged if that pretend operation was real.** In other words, it uses the exact same procedure a miner would use to calculate the actual fee but never mined into the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the estimate may be significantly different to the amount of gas actually used by the transaction if sent to the Ethereum network**, for a variety of reasons including EVM mechanics and blockchain state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the web3 interface to get a gas cost estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var result = web3.eth.estimateGas({\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gas price and transaction prioritization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas price is the amount (in ether) that the transaction sender is willing to pay for each unit of gas used. The miner who mines the next block gets to decide which transactions to include. Since gas price is factored into the transaction fee they will receive as a reward, they are more likely to include transactions with the highest gas prices first.** If the sender sets the gas price too low, they may have to wait a long time before their transaction gets confirmed. As such, **setting a gas price for a transaction is a trade off between trying to save money and how long you’re willing to wait for confirmation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Miners can also decide the order in which transactions are included in a block. **Since multiple miners are competing to append their block to the blockchain, the order of transactions within a block is arbitrarily decided by the \"winning\" miner and then the other miners verify with that order.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note that while transactions from different accounts can be ordered arbitrarily, transactions from an individual account must be executed in the order of the transaction nonces.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block gas limit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Block gas limits are the maximum amount of gas allowed in a block to determine how many transactions can fit into a block. For example, let’s say we have 5 transactions where their gas limits have been set to 30,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 and 50,000. If the block gas limit is 180,000, then four transactions can fit in the block, while the remaining transaction will have to wait for a future block.** As previously discussed, miners decide which transactions to include in a block. Different miners are likely to select different combinations, mainly due to the different orders that they are likely to receive them in. If a miner tries to include a transaction that requires more gas than the current block gas limit, it will be rejected by the network. **Most Ethereum clients will issue a warning even before that point, with a message along the lines of “transaction exceeds block gas limit”. The block gas limit is currently around 5 million gas at the time of writing according to https://etherscan.io, meaning around 238 transactions that each consume 21000 gas can fit into a block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who decides what the block gas limit is?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The miners on the network collectively decide what the block gas limit is. Individuals who want to mine on the Ethereum network use a mining program, such as ethminer, which connects to a Geth or Parity Ethereum client. The Ethereum protocol has a built in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit so capacity can be increased without having to coordinate on a hard fork. The miner of a block is able to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 (0.0976%) in either direction. The result of this is an adjustable block size based on the needs of the network at the time**. This mechanism is coupled with a default mining strategy where miners vote on a gas limit which is at least 4.7 million gas, but which targets a value of 150% of the average of recent total gas usage per block (using a 1024-block exponential moving average to be more precise). This allows for capacity to organically increase. Miners can choose to change this, but many of them do not and leave the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gas refund\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum encourages the deleting of used storage variables and accounts by refunding some of the gas used during contract execution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 operations in the EVM with what you might call negative gas costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deleting a contract (SELFDESTRUCT) is worth a refund of 24,000 gas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting a storage address holding a non-zero value to zero (SSTORE[x] = 0) is worth a refund of 15,000 gas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that the maximum refund is half the total amount of gas used for the transaction (rounding down). This is to clearly avoid mischievous activity based around this refund mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GasToken\n",
    "\n",
    "**GasToken is an ERC20 compliant token that allows anyone to \"bank\" gas when the gas price is low and use it when gas price is high. By making it a tradable asset, it essentially creates a gas market. It works by taking advantage of the gas refund mechanism described earlier.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn about the maths involved in calculating the profitability and how to use the released gas at https://gastoken.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rent fee\n",
    "\n",
    "There is currently a proposal in the Ethereum community about charging smart contracts a \"rent fee\" to be kept alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the case the rent would not be paid, the smart contract would be put to \"sleep\" making it and its data inaccessible even for a simple read. A contract put into sleep would need to be awakened by paying rent and submitting a Merkle proof.**\n",

    "# The Ethereum Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the heart of the Ethereum protocol and operation is the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM for short. As you might guess from the name, it is a computation engine**, not hugely dissimilar to the virtual machines of Microsoft’s .NET framework or LLVM, or interpreters of other byte code compiled programming languages, such as Java. In this section we take a detailed look at the EVM, including its instruction set, its structure and operation within the context of Ethereum state updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EVM is the part of the Ethereum protocol that handles smart contract deployment and execution. Simple value transfer transactions from an EOA to another EOA don’t need to involve the EVM, practically speaking, but everything else will.** In other words, anything other than a basic transfer of ether from one simple account to another simple account involves a state update computed by the EVM. **At a high level, the EVM running on the Ethereum blockchain can be thought of as a global decentralized computer containing millions of executable objects, each with their own permanent data store.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EVM is a <u>quasi-Turing complete state machine</u>, named such because all execution processes are necessarily limited to a finite number of computational steps as specified by the amount of gas available for any given smart contract execution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> As such, **the halting problem is \"solved\"** (all program executions will halt) and the situation where execution might (accidentally or maliciously) run forever (thus bringing the Ethereum platform to halt in its entirety) is avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EVM has a stack-based architecture, storing all in-memory values on a stack. It works with a word size of 256 bits (mainly to facilitate native hashing and elliptic curve operations) and has several addressable data components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an **immutable program code ROM**, loaded with the bytecode of the smart contract to be executed\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **volatile memory**, explicitly initialized to hold only zero values\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **permanent storage** that is part of the Ethereum state, and also all zeros\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a set of environment variables and data that are available during execution. We will go through these in more detail in this chapter, but you can see them in the architecture diagram [EVM_architecture]():\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Existing Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual Machine technologies such as Virtualbox and QEMU/KVM differ from the EVM in that their purpose is to provide hypervisor functionality, or a software abstraction that handles system calls, task scheduling, and resource management between a guest OS and the underlying host OS and hardware. **In contrast, the EVM is designed for a very focussed computational application, namely the execution of smart contracts to determine state updates to the Ethereum platform. The EVM has no scheduling capability, because execution ordering is organized externally to it - Ethereum clients run through verified block transactions to determine which smart contracts need executing and in which order. In this sense, the Ethereum world computer is single-threaded, like javascript**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Neither does the EVM have any \"system interface\" handling or \"hardware support\" - there is no physical machine to interface with. The Ethereum world computer is completely virtual.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EVM does, however, have similarities with certain aspects of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) specification, for example. From a high-level viewpoint, the JVM is designed to provide a runtime environment that is agnostic of the underlying host OS or hardware, enabling compatibility across a wide variety of systems. High level programming languages such as Java or Scala (that use the JVM), or C# (that uses .NET) are compiled into the bytecode instruction set of their respective virtual machine. **In the same way, the EVM executes its own bytecode instruction set (which we will look at below) which higher level smart contract programming languages, such as LLL, Serpent, Mutan or Solidity, are compiled into.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The EVM Instruction Set (Bytecode Operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "The EVM instruction set has most of the standard machine code instructions you might expect, including:\n",
    "\n",

    "- execution context inquiries<br><br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- process flow operations<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- logging, jumping and other operators\n",
    "\n",
    "**In addition to the typical bytecode operations, the EVM also has access to account information (e.g. address and balance), and block information (such as block number and current gas price).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start our exploration of the EVM in more detail by looking at the available opcodes and what they do. As you might expect, all operands are taken from the stack, and the result (where applicable) is often put back on the top of the stack.\n",

    "## Ethereum State\n",
    "\n",
    "**The job of the EVM is to update the Ethereum state by computing valid state transitions as a result of smart contact code execution, as defined by the Ethereum protocol**. <u>This aspect leads to the description of **Ethereum as a transaction-based state machine**, which reflects the aspect that external actors (i.e. account holders and miners) initiate state transitions by creating, accepting and ordering transactions.</u> \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful at this point to consider what consitutes the Ethereum state?\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the top level, we have the Ethereum world state. The world state is a mapping of Ethereum addresses (160 bit values) and accounts.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- At the lower level, each Ethereum address represents an account comprising:<br><br>\n",
    "    - an ether balance (stored as the number of Wei owned by the account), <br><br>\n",
    "    - a nonce (representing the number of transactions successfully sent from this account, if it is an EOA, or the number of contracts created by it, if it is a contract account),<br><br>\n",
    "    - the account’s storage (which is a permanent data store, only used by smart contracts), and <br><br>\n",
    "    - the account’s program code (again, only if the account is a smart contract account). An EOA will always have no code and a completely empty storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When a transaction results in smart contract code execution, an EVM is instantiated with all the information required in relation to the current block being created and the specific transaction being processed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular:\n",
    "- the EVM’s program code ROM is loaded with the code of the contract account being called, the program counter is set to zero, the storage is loaded from the contract account’s storage, the memory is set to all zeros and all the block and environment variables are set. <br><br>\n",
    "- A key variable is the gas supply for this execution, and it is set to the amount of gas paid for by the sender at the start of the transaction. As the code execution progresses, the gas supply is reduced according to the gas cost of the operations executed. <br><br>\n",
    "- If at any point the gas supply is reduced to zero we get an **\"Out of Gas\" (OOG) exception**; execution immediately halts and the transaction is abandoned. No changes to the Ethereum state are applied, except for the sender’s nonce being incremented and their ether balance going down to pay the block’s beneficiary for the resources used to execute the code to the halting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "**At this point, you can think of the EVM running on a sand-boxed copy of the Ethereum world state, with this sand-boxed version being discarded completely if execution can not complete for whatever reason. However, if the execution does complete successfully, then the real world state is updated to match the sand-boxed version, including any changes to the called contract’s storage data, any new contracts created and any ether balance transfers that were initiated.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, **because a smart contract can itself effectively initiate transactions, code execution is a recursive process. A contract can call other contracts, with each call resulting in another EVM being instantiated around the new target of the call. Each instantiation has its sand-box world state initialized from the sand-box of the EVM at the level above. Each instantiation is also given a specified amount of gas for its gas supply (not exceeding the amount of gas remaining in the level above, of course),** and so may itself exceptionally halt due to being given too little gas to complete its execution. Again, in such cases, the sand-box state is discarded, and execution returns to the EVM at the level above.\n",

    "You can investigate what’s going on here in detail using the opcode list given above in The EVM Instruction Set (Bytecode Operations). However, that’s quite a task, so let’s just start by examining the first four instructions as listed in opcode output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have PUSH1 followed with a raw byte of value 0x60. This corresponds to the EVM instruction which takes the single byte following the opcode in the program code (as a literal value) and pushing it onto the stack. It is possible to push values of size up to 32 bytes onto the stack: PUSH32 0x436f6e67726174756c6174696f6e732120536f6f6e20746f206d617374657221.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second PUSH1 opcode from opcode output stores 0x40 onto the top of the stack (pushing the 0x60 already present there down one slot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next is MSTORE, which is a memory store operation, that saves a value to the EVM’s memory. It takes two arguments and, like most EVM operations, uses the values on the stack to determine what those arguments should be. For each argument the stack is popped, i.e. the top value on the stack is taken off and all the other values on the stack are shifted up one position. The first argument for MSTORE is the address of the word in memory where the value to be saved will be put. For this program, we have 0x40 and so that is removed from the stack and used as the memory address. The second argument is the value to be saved, which is 0x60 here. After the MSTORE is executed, our stack is empty again, but we have the value 0x60 (i.e. 96 in decimal) at the memory location 0x40.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next opcode is CALLVALUE, which is an environmental opcode that pushes onto the top of the stack the amount of ether (measured in Wei) sent with the message call that initiated this execution.\n",

    "We could continue to step through this program in this way until we had a full understanding of the low level state changes that this code effects, but it wouldn’t help us at this stage. Instead, let’s keep going until we come back to this idea later in the section.\n",

    "## Contract Deployment Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is an important, but subtle difference between the code used when creating and deploying a new contract on the Ethereum platform and the code of the contract itself.**\n",

    "- Instead, an **EVM is instantiated with the code in the data field of the transaction loaded into its program code ROM and then the output of the execution of that deployment code is taken as the code for the new contract account.** This is so that new contracts can be programmatically initialized using the Ethereum world state at the time of deployment, set values in the contract’s storage and even send ether or create further new contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When compiling a contract offline, e.g. using solc on the command line, you can either get the deployment bytecode or the runtime bytecode.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The deployment bytecode is used for every aspect of the initialization of a new contract account**, including the bytecode of what will actually end up being executed when transactions call this new contract (i.e. the runtime bytecode), and the code to initialize everything based on the contract’s constructor. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The runtime bytecode, on the other hand, is exactly the bytecode that ends up being executed when the new contract is called and nothing more**, i.e. this does not include the bytecode needed to initialize the contract during deployment.\n",

    "\n",
    "**When you send a transaction to an ABI compatible smart contract (which you can assume all contracts are), the transaction first interacts with that smart contract’s dispatcher. The dispatcher reads in the data field of the transaction and sends the relevant part to the appropriate function**. We can see an example of a dispatcher at the beginning of our disassembled Faucet.sol runtime bytecode. After the familiar MSTORE instruction, we see the following instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PUSH1 0x4\n",
    "CALLDATASIZE\n",
    "LT\n",
    "PUSH1 0x3f\n",
    "JUMPI\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, PUSH1 0x4 places 0x4 onto the top of the stack, which is otherwise empty. CALLDATASIZE gets the size in bytes of the data sent with the transaction (known as the calldata) and pushes that number onto the stack. After these operations have been executed the stack looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Current stack:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<length of calldata from tx>\n",
    "0x4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This next instruction is LT, short for “less than”. The LT instruction checks whether the top item on the stack is less than the next item on the stack. In our case, it checks to see if the result of CALLDATASIZE is less than 4 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does the EVM check to see that the calldata of the transaction is at least 4 bytes? Because of how function identifiers work. Each function is identified by the first four bytes of its keccak256 hash. By placing the function’s name and what arguments it takes into a keccak256 hash function, we can deduce its function identifier. In our contract, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "keccak256(\"withdraw(uint256)\") = 0x2e1a7d4d...\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the function identifier for the withdraw(uint256) function is 0x2e1a7d4d, since these are the first four bytes of the resulting hash. A function identifier is always 4 bytes long, so if the entire data field of the transaction sent to the contract is less than 4 bytes, then there’s no function with which the transaction could possibly be communicating, unless a fallback function is defined. Because we implemented such a fallback function in Faucet.sol, the EVM jumps to this function when the calldata’s length is less than 4 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "LT pops off the top two values of the stack and, if the transaction’s data field is less than 4 bytes, pushes 1 onto it. Otherwise, it pushes 0. In our example, let’s assume the data field of the transaction sent to our contract was less than 4 bytes.\n",
    "\n",

    "0x3f\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next instruction is JUMPI, which stands for \"jump if\". It works like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jumpi(label, cond) // Jump to \"label\" if \"cond\" is true```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, \"label\" is 0x3f, which is where our fallback function lives in our smart contract. The \"cond\" argument is 1, which was the result of the LT instruction earlier. To put this entire sequence into words, the contract jumps to the fallback function if the transaction data is less than 4 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At 0x3f, only a \"STOP\" instruction follows, because, although we declared a fallback function, we kept it empty. Had we not implemented a fallback function, the contract would throw an exception instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Faucet_jumpi_instruction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s examine the central block of the dispatcher. Assuming we received calldata that was greater than 4 bytes in length. In this case the JUMPI instruction would not jump to the fallback function. Instead, code execution would follow with the next instructions:\n",

    "PUSH1 0x0 pushes 0 onto the stack, which is now otherwise empty again. CALLDATALOAD accepts as an argument an index within the calldata sent to the smart contract and reads 32 bytes from that index, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```calldataload(p) //load 32 bytes of calldata starting from byte position p```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 0 was the index passed to it from the PUSH1 0x0 command, CALLDATALOAD reads 32 bytes of calldata starting at byte 0, and then pushes it to the top of the stack (after popping the original 0x0). After the PUSH29 0x1000000... instruction, the stack is then:\n",

Here’s a hint: we read 32 bytes from calldata earlier starting at index 0. The first four bytes of that calldata is the function identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 0x100000000... we pushed earlier is 29 bytes long, consisting of a 1 at the beginning, followed by all 0s. Dividing our 32 bytes of calldata by this 0x100000000…​. will leave us only the topmost 4 bytes of our calldataload starting at index 0. These four bytes – the first four bytes in the calldata starting at index 0 – are the function identifier, and this is how the EVM extracts that field.\n",
    "\n",

Just as dividing by $10^{3}$ (1000) in our smaller example kept only the topmost digits, dividing our 32 byte base16 value by $16^{29}$ does the same.\n",

The DUP1 instruction duplicates the 1st item on the stack, which is the function identifier.

    "## Turing Completeness and Gas\n",
    "\n",
    "**As we have already touched on, in simple terms, a system or programming language is Turing complete if it can solve any problem you feed into it. This capability, however, comes with an very important caveat: some problems take forever to to solve. An important aspect of this is that we can’t tell, just by looking at a computer program, whether it will take forever or not to execute**. We have to actually go through with the execution of the program and wait for it to finish to find out. Of course, if it is going to take forever to execute, we will have to wait forever to find out. This is called \"**the halting problem**\" and would be a huge problem for Ethereum if it were not addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because of the halting problem, the Ethereum world computer is at risk of being asked to execute a program that never stops.** This could be by accident or because of malicious intent. **We have discussed that Ethereum acts like a single-threaded machine, without any scheduler, and so if it became stuck in an infinite loop, without gas, this would mean it would become unusable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, with gas, there is a fall-back: if after a pre-specified maximum amount of computation has been performed, the execution hasn’t ended, everything is stopped anyway. This makes the <u> EVM a quasi-Turing complete machine</u>: it can solve any problem you feed into it, but only if it turns out that the problem can be solved within a particular amount of time**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **That limit isn’t fixed in Ethereum - you can pay to increase it up to a maximum (called the \"block gas limit\") and everyone can agree to increase that maximum over time**. Nevertheless, at any one time, there is a limit in place, and transactions that take too long to execute are abandoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a smart contract developer, you must be very mindful of this. Some programs are simply too complex to be within any practical chance of ever getting successfully executed. A simple example would be a for-loop iterating over all the users of a DApp**: when the number of users goes over a certain number, the for-loop will take longer than is allowed to complete, so the iteration will always fail. In such circumstances, \"out of gas\" protections need to be put in place, such as having a \"gas supply check\" at end of a potentially unbounded for-loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gas Accounting During Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "For every transaction, there is an associated gas limit and gas price which are used to calculate fees of an EVM execution. We discuss this in detail in Gas section. **These fees are used to compensate for the necessary resources of a transaction, such as computation and memory, to fully resolve the effects of a transaction, including smart contract execution**. \n",
    "- When an EVM is needed to complete a transaction, in the first instance it is given a gas supply equal to the amount specified by the gas limit. <br><br>\n",
    "- Every opcode that is executed has a cost in gas, and so the EVM’s gas supply is reduced as the EVM steps through the program.<br><br>\n",
    "- Before each operation, the EVM checks that there is enough gas in its gas supply to pay for the operation’s execution. <br><br>\n",
    "    - If there isn’t, execution is halted and the transaction is abandoned. The originator of the transaction still pays for all the gas used at the specified gas price, however. <br><br>\n",
    "    - If the EVM gets to the end of execution successfully, without running out of gas, the value in ether of the gas remaining in the gas supply is refunded, based on the gas price of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, smart contract developers must be very mindful: if the gas price required to get a transaction confirmed goes up, it could become economically unfeasible to perform some calculations.\n",

    "# Consensus\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consensus within the Ethereum network refers to the capacity for multiple nodes, users or agents to agree on the \"world state\" of Ethereum at a given point in time**. This is closely related but distinct from the conventional definition of consensus, which is defined as a general agreement between individuals or groups around a particular topic or decision. **In the blockchain context, the community must solve the challenges of coming to consensus both technically (within the computer-run network) and socially (to ensure that the protocol does not fork or fracture).** This section will outline some of the technicalities around establishing consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the core function of decentralized record keeping and verification, it can become problematic to rely on trust alone to ensure that information derived from state updates is correct. **This rather general challenge is particularly pronounced in decentralized networks because there is no central entity to decide what should and should not be considered as truth. The lack of a central decision-making entity is one of the main attractions of blockchain platforms, because of the resulting capacity to resist censorship and the lack of dependence on authority for permission in the access to information**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, these benefits come at a cost: without a trusted arbitrator, any disagreements, deceptions or differences need to be reconciled using other means. Possible approaches here include mathematical, economic and social techniques.** A decentralized system is therefore more resilient to attack but can be less decisive in responding to changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The capacity to come to consensus and trust information will have important implications for the future adoption and utility of blockchain platforms as hosts to new asset classes and blockchain technology as infrastructure. To address this challenge and maintain the valued property of decentralization, the community continues to experiment with different models of consensus**. We explore all this within this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consensus Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**A consensus metric is a measurable datum/data on which a blockchain network’s nodes must agree in order to establish and maintain consensus for the data contained in each block. In context of blockchain technology, consensus metrics are measured and approved by each network node every time a new block is to be added to the chain.** As a result of the consensus metric, blockchains act as chains of truth extended from one certainly verifiable fact to the next. Because of the consensus metric, a blockchain protocol’s nodes become mini-notaries, instantly able to tell a false copy of the blockchain from the true one and report that fact to the entire network. These measures are required in order to keep bad actors from defrauding the network by submitting blocks containing false information. **As a result of the consensus metric of a blockchain, its integrity is not only established but maintained over the long run.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consensus metrics take a variety of forms, but the two most important for this discussion are **risk-based metrics** and **work-based metrics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hash-Based Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commonly known as Proof-of-Work (PoW) metrics, these metrics establish consensus because protocols that use them set computers to work on finding difficult numbers, most commonly using a hash function to find suitable hashes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The difficulty in finding a hash that fits the parameters of the network requires nodes to commit processing power and use electricity to compete with other nodes to come up with a valid hash.** For the sake of illustration, consider supercomputers whose only job in life is to search all integers for prime numbers. Now consider a whole network of average computers. These computers, when put together, might be said to have the combined computational power of a supercomputer. **The only job for this network of computers is similarly to search possible numbers for another kind of number called a SHA-256 hash. These numbers have unique properties, just like prime numbers, that make them easily identifiable when discovered, despite the significant difficulty in producing a hash that fits the criteria set by the network**. One way of imagining the difference between computing a hash and verifying if a hash fits the parameters is to use the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle. This puzzle would be quite difficult and time consuming to do, but it would be easy to tell at a glance if it has been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When SHA-256 hashes are computed accurately they serve as an attestation that a certain amount of computing power has been used to find the number**. The most recent prime number to be found is $2^{77,232,917} − 1$. It was found by a computer just like SHA-256 hashes are found by computers. SHA-256 hashes are easier to find than new prime numbers, however the difficulty inherent in finding hashes is where hash-based metrics derive their power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every SHA-256 hash has 64 hexadecimal characters in it. For example, here is the SHA-256 hash for the word \"yank\".<br> \n",
    "`SHA256(\"yank\") = 45F1B9FC8FD5F760A2134289579DF920AA55830F2A23DCF50D34E16C1292D7E0`\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice how, despite the small change in the letters being hashed, the resulting output hashes are vastly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you hash enough random phrases, kind of like monkeys on a typewriter, eventually you will find a hash that matches a certain pattern. In the case of the hash for \"ya\", note that it begins with the pattern \"666\". This is similar to **the relatively primitive hash-based metric approach of Bitcoin, except Bitcoin requires that hashes be found by matching the pattern beginning with \"000\". Candidate hashes are created by tweaking block information and feeding it into the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. As long as the output hash has the right number of leading zeros, the network will accept it and the block reward can be yours.** If the output hash doesn’t have enough leading zeros, unlucky. You have to tweak some of the information in your block and hash again. **The more leading zeros required, the more difficult finding an acceptable hash will be.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the total number of processors wanting to mine Bitcoin seems to be continuously increasing, there is (currently) ever more compute effort per second going into finding SHA-256 hashes to confirm Bitcoin blocks. **The Bitcoin protocol deals with this ongoing change by periodically adjusting the difficulty of the consensus metric upwards, requiring an increased number of leading zeros for acceptable blocks. This acts as insurance that new blocks are created in roughly the same increments of time as previous blocks. For the Bitcoin network, that increment is targeted to ten minutes**, though it is often less because the Bitcoin network waits for roughly two weeks to adjust the difficultly. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **In contrast to this, Ethereum re-adjusts its difficultly every block, and thus does a very good job of maintaining the target block separation time average of about 14 seconds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk-Based Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commonly known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) metrics, these establish consensus based on the fact that everyone who chooses to create invalid blocks stands to lose a great deal more than they have to gain by creating valid ones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **This metric is manufactured by consensus not about external off-chain data, but about internal on-chain data.** Hash-based consensus metrics are primarily concerned with the quality and precise nature of SHA-256 hashes. Risk-based metrics are primarily concerned with the risk which any particular node takes when adding a new block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric that all nodes agree upon here is which nodes have created correct blocks and which have not. In a way, this is already built into the Bitcoin protocol. The Bitcoin protocol assumes that the correct block is the one which the most nodes are mining. It assumes that the miners will not choose an incorrect block, as that is not in their best interests to mine bad blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk-based chains on the other hand, depend upon quick, immediate, and irreversible repercussions to any block creators that fail to create what other nodes in the network consider to be quality blocks**. By enforcing risk of resources lost, the process of hash-based metrics (which also relies on people not wanting to waste resources to work) can be shortcutted and implemented in a simpler way. **Research is currently underway to implement this model of consensus metric in Ethereum.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of work is a consensus protocol that considers the valid blockchain in the network to be the chain that was most computationally expensive to create.** The computational work that is referred to here is the work that had to be done to add all of the blocks to the current blockchain. This work is done by network nodes and must be computationally difficult, so as to make the work non-trivial, but must also be feasible, so as to be attainable after a reasonable amount of effort is exerted. Ultimately, the network will rely on nodes providing this PoW in order to maintain the blockchain and is, therefore, in the best interest of the network to require a sensible PoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the Ethereum network, as well as in many other blockchain networks, obtaining the PoW requires finding a hash of the block that is to be added to the blockchain. This hash is obtained by hashing a string consisting of the block’s data and a nonce (the method of creating this string may vary but the overall process is the same). This hash must be less than a certain threshold (determined by the difficulty of the network) and as soon as a node presents a nonce that produces this hash, the corresponding block is accepted and added to the blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The way this valid hash is found is by modifying the nonce, usually initializing it to zero and incrementing at each iteration until a hash that is below the network threshold is produced. This process is called mining. Due to the nature of the hash functions used in mining the only way to find a valid nonce is through brute force, i.e. checking every possible value of the nonce until a hash that meets the network requirements is found. It is for this reason that providing a valid nonce is considered a PoW.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depend on a validator’s economic stake in the network**. \n",
    "- In proof of work (PoW) based public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin and the current implementation of Ethereum), the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining).<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum’s upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). **Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In general, a proof of stake algorithm looks as follows:**\n",
    "- The blockchain keeps track of a set of validators, and anyone who holds the blockchain’s base cryptocurrency (in Ethereum’s case, ether) can become a validator by sending a special type of transaction that locks up their ether into a deposit. \n",
    "- The process of creating and agreeing to new blocks is then done through a consensus algorithm that all current validators can participate in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are many kinds of consensus algorithms, and many ways to assign rewards to validators who participate in the consensus algorithm, so there are many \"flavors\" of proof of stake.** From an algorithmic perspective, there are two major types: \n",
    "- chain-based proof of stake and \n",
    "- BFT-style proof of stake.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **chain-based proof of stake**, the algorithm pseudo-randomly selects a validator during each time slot (e.g. every period of 10 seconds might be a time slot), and assigns that validator the right to create a single block, and this block must point to some previous block (normally the block at the end of the previously longest chain), and so over time most blocks converge into a single constantly growing chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **BFT-style proof of stake**, validators are randomly assigned the right to propose blocks, but agreeing on which block is canonical is done through a multi-round process where every validator sends a \"vote\" for some specific block during each round, and at the end of the process all (honest and online) validators permanently agree on whether or not any given block is part of the chain. Note that blocks may still be chained together; the key difference is that consensus on a block can come within one block, and does not depend on the length or size of the chain after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PoA\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of Authority (PoA) is a subset of PoS consensus algorithms mainly used by testnets and private or consortium networks. In PoA-based blockchains, transaction validity is ultimately determined by a set of approved on-chain accounts, referred to as 'authority nodes'**. The criteria for determining authority nodes are decided deterministically through an approach codified in the network’s governance structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **PoA is widely considered to be the fastest route to consensus but relies on the assumption that the validating node has not been compromised.** Non-validating actors can access and use the network just as they would a public Ethereum network (by leveraging p2p transactions, contracts, accounts etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**PoA consensus relies on the validators reputation and past performance. The idea is that the validator node is staking its identity/reputation to mine. An important aspect in private consortium networks is the link between on-chain addresses to known, real world identities. Thus, we can say that the validating nodes are staking their \"identity\" or \"reputation\" (rather than their economic holdings)**. This creates some level of accountability for validators and is best suited for enterprise, private, or test networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PoA is currently employed by the test network Kovan, the PoA network, and can be configured easily in Parity for private consortiums networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DPoS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a modified form of Proof of Stake where network participants vote to elect an array of delegates (also called witnesses) to validate and secure the blockchain. These delegates are somewhat similar to authority nodes in PoA, except their authority may be revoked by the voters.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In DPoS consensus, like in PoS, the weight of the vote is proportional to the amount of stake injected by the user. This creates a scenario where larger token holders have proportionally more voting power than smaller ones**. This makes sense from a game theoretical perspective, as those with the more economic '**skin-in-the-game**' will naturally have a larger incentive to elect the most efficient delegate witnesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In addition, delegate witnesses receive a reward for validating each block and thus are incentivized to remain honest and efficient - so as to not be replaced. However, there are ways to make a “bribe” that are quite plausible**; for example, an exchange can offer interest rates for deposits (or, even more ambiguously, use the exchange’s own money to build a great interface and features), with the exchange operator using the large quantity of deposits to vote as they wish in a DPoS consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethash: Ethereum-PoW \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethash is an Ethereum Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm that is dependent on the generation and analysis of a large dataset, known as the DAG (simply because it is a directed acyclic graph**). The DAG started with a size of about 1GB and will continue to slowly and linearly grow in size for ever more, being updated once every epoch (30,000 blocks, or roughly 125 hours). **The Ethash PoW algorithm uses a version of the Dagger-Hashimoto Algorithm**, which is a combination of Vitalik Buterin’s Dagger algorithm and Thaddeus Dryja’s Hashimoto algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seed, Cache, Data Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The general route that the algorithm takes is as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There exists a seed which can be computed for each block by scanning through the block headers up until that point.<br><br>\n",
    "- From the seed, one can compute a 16 MB pseudorandom cache. Light clients store the cache.<br><br>\n",
    "- From the cache, we can generate a 1 GB dataset, with the property that each item in the dataset depends on only a small number of items from the cache. Full clients and miners store the dataset. The dataset grows linearly with time.<br><br>\n",
    "- Mining involves grabbing random slices of the dataset and hashing them together.<br><br>\n",
    "- Verification can be done with low memory by using the cache to regenerate the specific pieces of the dataset that you need, so you only need to store the cache.\n",

    "## Why does using GPUs matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although Ethereum can be mined using CPUs, using them to mine Ethereum would not be a profitable exercise. Today the bulk of the mining relies on the use of Graphical Processing Units (GPU). Modern GPUs—while great for 3D graphics and gaming are also excellent at processing the memory intensive Dagger-Hashimoto Algorithm which is necessary for PoW consensus on the Ethereum network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of \"normal\" GPUs for carrying out the PoW on the Ethereum network means that more people around the world can participate in the mining process. The more independent miners there are the more decentralize the mining power and we can avoid a situation like with Bitcoin where much of the mining power is concentrated in the hands of a few large industrial mining operations**. The downside of the use of GPUs for mining is it led to the worldwide shortage GPUs in 2017 causing their price to rocket and an outcry from gamers. This led to purchase restrictions at retailers limiting buyers to a single GPU per customer or two if you are in luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Until recently, the threat of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners on the Ethereum network was largely non-existent. To use ASIC for Ethereum requires the design, manufacturing, and distribution of highly customized hardware. Producing them requires considerable investment in time and expense for design, tooling, and manufacturing**. <u>The Ethereum developers' long expressed plans to move to a PoS consensus algorithm likely kept ASIC suppliers away from targeting the Ethereum network for a long time</u>. As soon as Ethereum moves to PoS, the ASICs designed for the consensus algorithm will be rendered useless—that is unless miners can use it to mine other cryptocurrencies instead. **The latter option is now a reality with a range of other Ethash based consensus coins available such as PIRL, Ubiq, and of course Ethereum Classic which has pledged to remain a PoW coin for the foreseeable future**. This means that we will likely see ASIC mining begin to become a force on the Ethereum network while is it still operating on PoW consensus.\n",

    "## Casper\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: [Ethereum Casper](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/ethereum-casper/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is proof of work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin run on “proof-of-work.” Proof-of-work as a process has the following steps to it:\n",
    "- The miners solve cryptographic puzzles to “mine” a block to add to the blockchain.\n",
    "- This process requires an immense amount of energy and computational usage. The puzzles have been designed in a way which makes it hard and taxing on the system.\n",
    "- When a miner solves the puzzle, they present their block to the network for verification.\n",
    "- Verifying whether the block belongs to the chain or not is an extremely simple process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem with proof of work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, there are quite a few problems with proof-of-work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First and foremost, proof of work is an extremely inefficient process because of the sheer amount of power and energy that it eats up.\n",
    "- People and organizations that can afford faster and more powerful ASICs usually have a better chance of mining than the others.\n",
    "- Theoretically speaking, these big mining pools can simply team up with each other and launch a 51% on the bitcoin network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, to solve these problems, Ethereum looked to Proof of Stake as a solution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Proof of stake?\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of stake will make the entire mining process virtual and replace miners with validators.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the process will work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The validators will have to lock up some of their coins as stake.\n",
    "- After that, they will start validating the blocks. Meaning, when they discover a block which they think can be added to the chain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it.\n",
    "- If the block gets appended, then the validators will get a reward proportionate to their bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PoW-Vs-PoS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Biggest Roadblock to Proof of Stake: Nothing at Stake\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum developers always planned to eventually move on to proof of stake, that was always their plan. However, before they could do so, they had to address one of the biggest flaws of proof of stake(POS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this scenario for a moment:\n",
    "![](./Images/NthingAtStake.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a situation like the one above.  There are a main blue chain and a red chain which sort of branches from the main itself. What is there to stop a malicious miner from mining on the red blocks and force a hardfork?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a proof-of-work(POW) system, this risk can be mitigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose malicious miner Alice wants to mine on the red chain. Even if she dedicates all of her hash power to it, she won’t get any other miner to join her on the new chain. Everyone else will still continue to mine on the blue chain, because it is more profitable and risk-free to mine on the longer chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now, remember, POW is extremely expensive resource-wise. It makes no sense for a miner to waste so much resource on a block that will be rejected by the network anyway**. Hence chain splits are avoided in a proof of work system because of the amount of money that the attacker will have to waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, things look a little different when you bring in POS. **If you are a validator, then you can simply put your money in both the red chain and blue chain without any fear of repercussion at all. No matter what happens, you will always win and have nothing to lose, despite how malicious your actions maybe.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the “**Nothing at Stake**” problem, and this is something that Ethereum had to address. They needed a protocol which could implement POS and mitigate the “Nothing at Stake” problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enter Etheruem Casper\n",
    "\n",
    "Casper is the POS protocol that Ethereum has chosen to go with. While there has been an entire team busy creating it, Vlad Zamfir is often credited as being the “Face of Casper.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**So how is Casper different from other Proof of Stake protocols?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Casper has implemented a process by which they can punish all malicious elements.** This is how POS under Casper would work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The validators stake a portion of their Ethers as stake.<br><br>\n",
    "- After that, they will start validating the blocks. Meaning, when they discover a block which they think can be added to the chain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it.<br><br>\n",
    "- If the block gets appended, then the validators will get a reward proportionate to their bets.<br><br>\n",
    "- However, **if a validator acts in a malicious manner and tries to do a “nothing at stake”, they will immediately be reprimanded, and all of their stake is going to get slashed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Casper is designed to work in a trustless system and be more [Byzantine Fault Tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anyone who acts in a malicious/Byzantine manner will get immediately punished by having their stake slashed off. This is where it differs from most other POS protocols**. Malicious elements have something to lose so it is impossible for there to be nothing at stake.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not the only place where Casper punishes the validators.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As Hudson James and Joris Bontje note in their answers in “StackExchange,” Casper designs harsher incentives to guarantee network security, including punishing miners who go offline, unintentionally or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This means that validators will have to be careful about their node uptime. Carelessness or laziness will lead to them losing their stake**. This property reduces censorship of transactions and overall availability. Along with all that, the “slashing” property also lends Casper a distinct edge over standard proof of work protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s bring back our chain diagram again:\n",
    "![](./Images/NthingAtStake.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a proof of work protocol, it doesn’t matter whether a miner mined on the blue chain or the red chain. Both the honest and the malicious miner would have spent the same amount of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Casper, however, if an honest validator mines on the blue chain then they would get reward proportionate to their bet, however, a malicious miner will get their stake slashed off for betting on the red chain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethereum Casper vs. Ethereum Casper?\n",
    "\n",
    "Casper is not one specific project. It is an amalgamation of two research projects which is currently being undertaken by the Ethereum dev team. The two projects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG)**\n",
    "- **Casper the Friendly GHOST: Correct-by-Construction (CBC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Casper FFG\n",
    "\n",
    "**Casper FFG aka Vitalik’s Casper is a hybrid POW/POS consensus mechanism. This is the version of Casper that is going to be implemented first**. This is pretty much designed to ease the transition into proof of stake. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The way it is designed is that there is a proof-of-stake protocol overlaying on top of the normal ethash proof of work protocol. So while blocks are still going to be mined via POW, every 50th block is going to be a POS checkpoint where finality is assessed by a network of validators.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So what is finality?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finality, in very loose terms, means that once a particular operation has been done, it will forever be etched in history and nothing can revert that operation**. This is particularly important in fields which deal with finance. Imagine that Alice owns a particular amount of an asset in a company. Just give of some glitch in the company’s processes, she shouldn’t have to revert ownership of that asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some people say that proof-of-work is the one way that finality can be achieved in the blockchain. However, that is not necessarily true**. The truth is far more complex than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Vitalik Buterin notes, no system in the world provides 100% finality. It is possible to hack into a system, or physically break into a registry and tamper with numbers to change one’s mark sheet. That is a big problem with centralized institutions. However, decentralized systems have faced the same issue as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In fact, bitcoin, the poster child of proof-of-work mechanism has faced finality issues at least three times. On one instance, the chain had to fork because of a bug that existed in one version of the software and didn’t in another**. This led to a split in the community where one part refused to accept a chain that was accepted by the other half. This split was resolved in 6 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, the question is, how does Casper FFG provide finality?**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Vitalik, Casper is guaranteed to provide stronger finality than proof-of-work because of three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total Economic Finality. 2/3rd of validators make maximum odd bets to finalize the blocks. Because of this, there is very little incentive for them to collude and attack the network since they are jeopardizing their own deposits if they do so. Vlad Zamfir put it best when he said:” Imagine a version of the proof of work where if you participate in a 51% attack your mining hardware burns down”.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine that the entire network is made of three people: Alice, Bob and Charlie. Suppose Alice and Bob are placing their stakes behind one claim and Bob and Charlie are placing their stakes behind a contradictory claim. No matter what happens, either Alice or Charlie stands to lose a significant amount of money.So as you can see, the validators have no incentive to collude and act in a malicious manner because they always stand to lose a lot of money.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    " - However, if a double finality does occur, there is a contingency plan for that as well. If a double finality occurs, then users have a choice as to which chain they want to go for. Whatever chain gets the majority vote becomes the dominant chain. So basically, double finality in Casper would end up in a hard fork instead of a reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Casper CBC\n",
    "\n",
    "Casper CBC aka Vlad’s Casper uses the correct-by-construction (CBC) protocol. So what is, is the CBC protocol? (Most of the data taken from Vlad Zamfir’s edcon presentation and Jon Choi’s “Ethererum Casper 101” article).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what a normal protocol design looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You formally specify the protocol.\n",
    "- Define the properties that the protocol must satisfy.\n",
    "- Prove that the protocol satisfies the given properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what a CBC protocol looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You formally but partially specify the protocol.\n",
    "- Define properties that the protocol must specify.\n",
    "- Derive the protocol in a way that it satisfies all the properties that it was stated to specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In layman’s terms, you are sort of deriving the protocol dynamically. One of the ways to derive the full protocol is to implement an estimate safety oracle called an “ideal adversary” which does one of the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raises exceptions of a fault of a justified estimate.\n",
    "- Lists out any future failures that can happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what this ideal adversary is going to do, is that it is going to constantly fine-tune and perfect the partially built protocol until it is complete.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen, the Ethereum dev team has been hard at work with these two Casper projects. This is obviously not going to be the final version, but whatever it will be, will be heavily influenced by both Vlad’s and Vitalik’s Caspers. **As has been stated, Vitalik’s Casper is going to be implemented first to ease the transition from POS to POW. Vlad’s Casper, on the other hand, is going to derive a safety proof via the utilization of an ideal adversary.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need Ethereum Casper?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several advantages of implementing proof-of-stake. They can all be broadly listed down among the following categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps achieve decentralization.\n",
    "- Energy efficiency.\n",
    "- Economic security.\n",
    "- Scaling.\n",
    "- Transition to POS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Achieving Decentralisation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen above, POW protocols are not really decentralization friendly anymore. Let’s check out the hashrate distribution chart for bitcoin:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/hashrateDistrBTC.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is the hashrate distribution of the mining pools in Ethereum:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/hashrateDistrEth.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the majority of the hashrate is concentrated within some specific pools, and this means that no matter what happens, they will always have a better chance of mining blocks and obtaining rewards than anyone else. **Because they can obtain more money, they can, therefore, afford better and faster ASICs. This basically means, no matter what happens, big mining pools will always have an edge over individuals and smaller pools.** In other words, the rich will always get richer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof-of-stake makes this completely irrelevant by making mining completely virtual**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Energy Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest problem of Proof-of-work is the energy wastage. The worst part is that it is energy wastage for the sake of energy wastage. Bitcoin, in particular, is voracious in its appetite for energy. **It is quite obvious that bitcoin eats a lot of power, and there is a lot of money spent on the resources. However, what about the external costs? The effect that this amount of power consumption has on the environment must be immense.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is no doubt that bitcoin and POW has made a lot of positive social changes, **we should at least see what a large scale POS system can do and whether it work just as well without consuming so much power.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Economic Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest advantage that POS, and especially Casper, has is its economic security. Think about this, **suppose you are a validator and you have your own money stored up as the stake in the network. It is in your own interests to act in the best interest of the network. Why would you act maliciously knowing that there is a huge part of your stake which can be slashed away and taken over if you do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you attack a network and harm the coin’s value when you have so much of your currency locked up in it?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transition to POS\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is more of a philosophical discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "People, in general, are not that good with change. When they get used to something, it is very difficult for them to get out of that comfort zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be particularly tricky for a currency system whose value is entirely based on its perceived value by the masses. As of writing, Ethereum is worth 32 billion USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It will be incredibly irresponsible to drop the POS bomb on the people and expect them to just get with the times. It might reduce the public’s faith in the system, and the value of Ethereum may drop. Hence, it is much more prudent to have a gentle transition from POW to POS that Casper FFG is planning to do.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### So do the “rich get richer”?\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the most recurring criticisms of the POS protocol is that it is just making the rich people richer. Since in order to even qualify as a validator, you need to lock up a significant portion of your fund as a stake and even then, you will get rewards in proportion to the amount that you are betting.** So, if you have more money in the system you will get more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Jon Choi in his article refutes this as so:\n",
    "> \"The main takeaway here should be that Proof of Stake is considerably more egalitarian (i.e., gives less benefit to having more capital) than the incumbent Proof of Work-based algorithm of Bitcoin.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In a POS a dollar is still a dollar, and big pools can’t get away with having more hashrate for the same amount of money invested. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Future of Ethereum Casper\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, as of writing, Vitalik Buterin said that not only is Casper ready for testing but it could provide a security boost when testing code across clients. While it doesn’t look like it is ready for widespread adoption yet, it looks like the date of the first Casper testnet is coming closer and closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I**t is not a question of IF proof of stake is going to be implemented or not, it is a question of WHEN**. Ethereum Serenity is supposed to be a proof-of-stake network. It is not like we have never seen an implementation of POS before, Peercoin implemented it quite successfully. However, we have never seen the adoption of the protocol at this level before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe, if Casper is implemented successfully, the other cryptocurrencies may follow suit and make the transition as well. Whatever be the case, Casper brings in a lot of enticing possibilities.\n",

Valid candidate blocks in each Parachain is determined based on the Availability and Validity of transactions, since according to the Consensus Mechanism the Destination Validators (next block) may only enact incoming messages from Source Validators (previous block) when they have sufficient transaction information that is both Available and Valid.

    "# Communications between nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is simplified vision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum nodes communicate among themselves using a simple wire protocol, ÐΞVp2p, forming a virtual or overlay well-formed network**. To achieve this goal, this protocol called ÐΞVp2p, uses technologies and standards such as RLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transport protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "**In order to provide confidentiality and protect against network disruption, ÐΞVp2p nodes use RLPx messages, an encrypted and authenticated transport protocol. RLPx utilizes a routing algorithm similar to Kademlia, which is a distributed hash table (DHT) for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> RLPx, as an underlying transport protocol, allows among other, \"Node Discovery and Network Formation\". Another remarkable feature of RLPx is the support of multiple protocols over a single connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When ÐΞVp2p nodes communicate via Internet (as they usually do), they use TCP, which provides a connection-oriented medium, but actually ÐΞVp2p nodes communicate in terms of packets, using the so-called facilities (or messages) provided by the underlying transport protocol RLPx, allowing them to communicate sending and receiving packets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Packets are dynamically framed, prefixed with an RLP encoded header, encrypted and authenticated. Multiplexing is achieved via the frame header which specifies the destination protocol of a packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encrypted Handshake\n",
    "**Connections are established via a handshake and, once established, packets are encrypted and encapsulated as frames.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This **handshake will be carried out in two phases**: \n",
    "- the first phase involves the keys exchange and \n",
    "- the second phase will perform authentication, and as a part of DEVp2p, will also exchange the capabilities of each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security - Basic considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**All cryptographic operations are based on secp256k1** and each node is expected to maintain a static private key which is saved and restored between sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Until encryption is implemented, packets have a timestamp property to reduce the window of time for carrying out replay attacks. It is recommended that the receiver only accepts packets created within the last 3 seconds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Packets are signed. Verification is performed by recovering the public key from the signature and checking that it matches an expected value.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ÐΞVp2p messages and Sub-protocols\n",
    "**With RLP we can encode different types of payloads, whose types are determined by the integer value used in the first entry of the RLP. In this way, ÐΞVp2p, the basic wire protocol, support arbitrary sub-protocols.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message IDs between 0x00-0x10 are reserved for ÐΞVp2p messages**. Therefore, the message IDs of sub-protocols are assumed to be from 0x10 onwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-protocols that are not shared between peers are ignored.** If multiple versions of the same (equal name) sub-protocol are shared, the numerically highest wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic establishment of communication - Basic ÐΞVp2p message\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a very basic example, when two peers initiate their communication, each one greets the other with a special ÐΞVp2p message called \"Hello\", which is identified by the 0x00 message ID. Through this particular ÐΞVp2p \"Hello\" message, each node will disclose to its peer relevant data that will allow the communication to begin at a very basic level.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, each peer will know the following information about his peer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The implemented version of the P2P protocol. Now must be 1.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The client software identity, as a human-readable string (e.g. Ethereum(++)/1.0.0).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Peer capability name as an ASCII string of length 3. Currently supported capability names are eth and shh.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Peer capability version as a positive integer. Currently supported versions are 34 for eth, and 1 for shh.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- The Unique Identity of the node specified as a 512-bit hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disconnection - Basic ÐΞVp2p message\n",
    "**To carry out an ordered disconnection, the node that wants to disconnect, will send a ÐΞVp2p message called \"Disconnect\", which is identified by the \"0x01\" message id. Furthermore, the node specifies the reason for the disconnection using the parameter \"reason\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"reason\" parameter can take values from 0x00 to 0x10, e.g. 0x00 represents the reason \"Disconnect requested\" and 0x04 represents \"Too many peers\".\n",

    "\n",
    "The peer-to-peer movement has enabled millions of Internet users to connect together. **USENET, a distributed messaging system that is described as the first peer-to-peer architecture, was established in 1979 as the successor of the first 'Internet', ARPANET**. ARPANET was a client-server network where participants ran nodes requesting and serving content, but, as it lacked the ability to provide any means for context beyond simple address-based routing, USENET emerged, promising to enforce a decentralized model of control. The USENET model was a client-server model from the user (or client) perspective, but offered a self-organizing approach to the newsgroup servers. This made news servers communicate with one another as peers to propagate USENET news articles over the entire group of network servers. **This is also like SMTP email, in which the core e-mail-relaying network of mail transfer agents has a peer-to-peer character, in contrast to the periphery of e-mail clients and their direct connections which is strictly a client-server relationship.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In 1999 the famous music- and file-sharing application called Napster arose. Napster was the beginning of the peer-to-peer networks movement evolving into BitTorrent, where participating users established a virtual network, entirely independent from the physical network and without having to obey any administrative authorities or restrictions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As peer-to-peer mechanisms can be used to access any kind of distributed resources, they play a central role in decentralized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a DApp?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a traditional software application, a **Decentralized Application (DApp) does not belong only to one single provider or server. Instead, the whole stack is deployed and operated in a distributed fashion on a peer-to-peer (p2p) network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A typical DApp stack would consist of front-end, back-end and data storage.** There are many advantages to creating a DApp that a typical centralized architecture can not provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resiliency**<br>\n",
    "By having the business-logic controlled by a smart contract, **a DApp back-end will be fully distributed and managed on a blockchain platform. Unlike deploying an application on a centralized server, a DApp will have no downtime and will continue to persist as long as the platform is still operating.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transparency**<br>\n",
    "**The on-chain nature of a DApp allows everyone to inspect the code and be more sure about its function. On the same note, any interaction with the the DApp will be stored forever in the blockchain state history**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Censorship Resistance**<br>\n",
    "**As long as a user has access to an Ethereum node (running one if necessary), the user will always be able to interact with a DApp without interference from any centralized control**. No service provider, or even the owner of the smart contract, could alter the code once it is deployed on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is worth noting that once deployed, any smart contract becomes fully publicly viewable, and so anyone can take the contract’s bytecode and re-deploy it themselves. This makes developing successful business models more difficult in the context of blockchain platforms.** Nonetheless, the other attributes of such platforms more than off-set such a narrow detriment.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is also worth noting that it may not be possible to de-compile the bytecode into high-level source code and fully understand the contract’s code. **Developers who seek to offer full transparency about the contract behavior must publish the source code for users to read, compile and verify.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of a DApp\n",
    "\n",
    "A DApp comprises several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decentralized (i.e. on-chain) computation, related state, and value transfer**, aka smart contracts**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decentralized data storage**, such as IPFS or Swarm<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decentralized messaging**, such as Whisper<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User front-end interface(s)**, usually written in the same languages as web interfaces and rendered in a web browser\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the Ethereum ecosystem as it stands today, there are very few truly decentralized apps - most still rely on centralized service and servers for some part of their operation**. For example, the storage of front-end assets on servers owned and operated by the developer, or the provision of \"real-world\" information, such as the current price of ether. In the future, we expect that it will be possible for every part of any DApp to be operated in a truly and fully decentralized way, including access to \"real world\" data, such as price info or weather data. Data providers in our blockchain context are called \"**oracles**\" and provide a not insignificant challenge to the move to decentralization. Nevertheless, **we are already on the way with the launch of Augur and other similar stake-based oracle services**. We discuss this approach more in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On-chain Computation (Smart Contracts)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The smart contract is used to store the business logic (program code) and the related state of your decentralized application; in the first instance, you can think of a smart contract as a server-side component in a regular application**. Of course, it is more than this and less than this, but as a starting point, it is an adequate way of getting a handle on DApp architecture. **One of the main differences is that any computation executed in a smart contract is very expensive and so should be kept as minimal as possible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The designing Ethereum DApp architecture can go well beyond simple decision tree logic: Ethereum smart contracts allow you to build almost arbitrarily complex architectures in which a network of smart contracts call and pass data between each other, reading and writing their own state variables as they go**. We have to add \"almost\" in our description, because the amount of computation that can be done in one atomic unit (transaction) will always be limited to some degree, as specified by the (possibly very large) block gas limit. **After deploying your smart contract, your business logic could well be used by many other developers in the future, without ever requiring you to manage or maintain the code, which is nice.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>One major consideration of smart contract architecture design is the inability to change the code of a smart contract once it is deployed</u>. **It can be deleted if it is programmed with an accessible SELFDESTRUCT opcode, but other than complete removal, the code cannot be changed in any way. One reason why the Ethereum platform is designed this way is to maximize the degree to which users can know what smart-contract based services will do; it would undermine this to allow smart contract code to be replaced in any way after creation.** For example, a contract owner could write a contract that accepts ether deposits which will be returned in full after a fixed period of time, then wait until someone issues a transaction to deposit a large amount and change the code to allow them to withdraw the whole deposit for themselves. This is clearly a wholly undesirable feature for an otherwise immutable smart contract platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, **it is possible for a smart contract to call into other smart contracts as specified by a contract state variable, thus allowing for the switching of which other contract code is called and giving a maintenance and upgrade path for DApps**. You may wonder, after thinking about the malign example above, why anyone would ever use a contract that they can see allows for parts of its operation to be changed; the difference is that fixed code contracts must explicitly specify exactly how and to what extent they rely on possible code changes. For example,**a DApp can make contract call address changes only after being approved by a special council or user vote, or they can be architected to separate computation from any ether spending, making it so any deposit you have given it always needs your approval before being transferred. Great care is needed when employing this strategy, but it is very powerful.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>The second major consideration of smart contract architecture design is DApp size</u>; **a really large monolithic smart contract may cost a lot of gas to deploy and use. Therefore, some applications may choose to have off chain computation and an external data source. Keep in mind, however, that having the core business logic of the DApp be dependent on external data (e.g. from a centralized server) would mean your users will have to trust these externalities. The marketing to acquire this trust could end up being more costly than paying for on-chain resources.** An interesting balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Front end (Web User Interface (UI))\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike **the business logic of the DApp that requires a developer to understand the EVM and new languages such as Solidity, the client side interface of a DApp can use only basic web front end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc). This allows a traditional web developer to utilize the tools, libraries and frameworks they are familiar with using on a regular basis**. Interactions with the DApp such as signing messages, sending transactions and key management are often conducted through the browser itself using tools such as Mist browser or the Metamask browser extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although it is possible to create a mobile DApp as well, currently there are few resources to help create mobile DApp front-ends**, mainly due to the lack of mobile clients that can serve as a light client with key management functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due to high gas costs and the currently low block gas limit, smart contracts are not suited to store or process large amounts of data. Hence, most DApps will utilize off-chain data storage services. Ideally, a DApp should use decentralized storage platforms, such as IPFS or Swarm.** This is ideal for storing and distributing large static assets such as images, videos, and the rest of the client side application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decentralized storage platforms work by using hashes of the file contents as file handles for reference and retrieval.** The hashes of the content (or derivatives thereof) are often stored as bytes within the smart contract so that a user can be sure they are being served the correct content.\n",

    "\n",
    "Centralized databases are data stored on a server with some semantic indexing for fast retrieval. They use a client-server network architecture and can allow users to modify the data that is stored. Being centralized means that the problem of coordination of data changes by users is made much easier, compared with the same situation in a decentralized context. Furthermore, access control (e.g. read or write privileges) can be also easily managed and operated. However, the centralization means that attach vectors can be more focussed in comparison to decentralized systems, meaning access to and control of the data held can be compromised with potentially simple and inexpensive techniques (such as social engineering).\n",

    "# Oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "**A key property of the Ethereum platform is, of course, the Ethereum Virtual Machine, with its ability to execute programs written in its Turing complete bytecode language. Another key property is its decentralized organization through consensus on state updates**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Being able to deliver EVM driven state updates on a decentralized concensus platform has a crucial underpinning: EVM execution must be totally deterministic and based only on the shared context of the Ethereum state and signed transactions</u>. **This has two particularly important consequences:**\n",
    "- the first is that there can be no instrinsic source of randomness for the EVM and smart contracts to work with; and \n",
    "- second is that all extrinsic data can only be introduced as the data payload of a transaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s unpick those two consequences slightly more. To understand the prohibition of a rand() function in the EVM to provide randomness for smart contracts, consider the effect on attempts to achieve consensus after the execution of such a function: node **A would execute the command and store 3 on behalf of the smart contract in its storage and node B, executing the same smart contract, would store 7 instead. Thus, nodes A and B would come to different conclusions about what the resulting state should be, despite having run exactly the same code in the same context**. Indeed, it could easily be that a different resulting state would be achieved every time that the smart contract is evaluated. As such, there would be no way for the network, with its multitude of nodes running independently around the world, to ever come to a decentralized consensus on what the resulting state should be. In practice, it would get much worse than this example very quickly, because knock-on effects, including ether transfers, would build up exponentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that pseudo-random functions, such as cryptographically secure hash functions (which are deterministic and therefore can be, and indeed are, part of the EVM), are not enough for many applications: take a gambling game that simulates coin flips to resolve bet payouts, which needs to randomize heads or tails - a miner can gain an advantage by playing the game and only including their transactions in blocks for which they will win. So how do we get around this problem? Well, all nodes can agree on the contents of signed transactions, so extrinsic information, including sources of randomness, price information, weather forecasts, etc, can be introduced as the data part of transactions sent to the network. However, such data simply can not be trusted, coming as it does from completely anonymous sources. As such, we have just deferred the problem. In this section we investigate the solution: oracles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oracles, ideally, provide a trustless (or at least near-trustless) way of getting extrinsic (i.e. \"real world\" or off-chain) information, such as the result of football games, the price of gold, or truely random numbers, on to the Ethereum platform for smart contracts to use**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**They can also be used to relay data securely to DApp front-ends directly. They can be thought of as a bridge, i.e. a mechanism for bridging the gap between the off-chain world and smart contracts**. Allowing smart contracts to enforce contractual relationships based on real-world events and data broadens their scope dramatically. Note that some oracles provide data that is particular to a specific private data source, such as academic certificates or government IDs. Even though that is a fully trusted data source, it is so by definition. Such subjective data can’t be given \"trustlessly\" - the provider of such information, such as a university, is the sole arbitor of this information, so it only makes sense to go to the single source of this information to obtain it. As such, we include these data sources in our definitions of what counts as \"oracles\" because they also provide a data bridge for smart contracts with the characteristic of the data being provided. The kind of subjective data generally takes the form of certifications, such as passports or records of achievement. **Certifications will become a big part of the success of blockchain platforms, particularly when the reputation problem is solved, so it is important they are included and that you understand how they can be served by blockchain platforms.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at some more examples of data that might be provided by oracles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random numbers/entropy from physical sources (e.g. quantum/thermal phenomenon): e.g. to fairly select a winner in a lottery smart contract<br><br>\n",

    "In this section, we will examine some of the ways oracles can be implemented, including basic oracle patterns, computation oracles, decentralized oracles, and oracle client implementations in Solidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Oracle Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "All oracles provide a few key functions, by definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collecting data from an off-chain source<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transferring the data on-chain with a signed message<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making the data available by putting it in a smart contract’s storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**With the data in the smart contract’s storage, it can be accessed by other smart contracts via message calls that invoke a \"retrieve\" function of the oracle’s smart contract; and it can also be accessed by Ethereum nodes or network enabled clients directly by \"looking\" into the oracle’s storage.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The three main ways to set up an oracle can be categorized as:**\n",
    "- immediate-read,\n",
    "- publish-subscribe and\n",
    "- request-response, \n",
    " \n",
    "### Immediate-Read Oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the simplest, **immediate-read oracles are those that provide data which is only needed for an immediate decision, like \"What is the address for mastering-ethereum.com?\" or \"Is this person over 18?\". Those wishing to query this kind of data tend to do so on a \"just-in-time\" basis, i.e. the look-up is made when it is needed and possibly never again**. Examples of such oracles include those that hold data about or issued by organizations, such as academic certificates, dial codes, institutional memberships, airport indentifiers, sovereign IDs, etc. This type of oracle stores data once in its contract storage, whence any other smart contract can look it up using a request call to the oracle contract. It may be updated The data in the oracle’s storage is also available for direct look-up by blockchain enabled (i.e. Ethereum client connected) applications without having to go through the palaver of incurring the gas costs of issuing a transaction. A shop wanting to check the age of a customer wishing to purchase alcohol could use an oracle in this way. **This type of oracle is attractive to an organization or company that might otherwise have to run and maintain servers to answer such data requests. Once in an oracle smart contract, the Ethereum platform takes care of everything**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the data stored by the oracle is likely not to be the raw data that the oracle is serving, e.g. for efficiency or privacy reasons**. **A university may set up an oracle for the certificates of academic achievement of past students. However, storing the full details of the certificate (which may run to pages of courses taken and grades achieved) would be excessive. Instead, a hash of the certificate is sufficient.** Likewise, a government might wish to put citizen IDs on to the Ethereum platform, where clearly the details included need to be kept private. \n",
    "> Again, hashing the data (more carefully, in Merkle trees with salts) and only storing the root hash in the smart contract’s storage is an efficient way to organize such a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publish-Subscribe Oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "**The next set up is publish-subscribe, where an oracle, that effectively provides a broadcast service for data that is expected to change (perhaps both regularly and frequently), is either polled by a smart contract on-chain, or watched by an off-chain daemon for updates.** This category has a pattern similar to RRS feeds, WebSub, and the like, where the oracle is updated with new information and a flag signals that new data is available to those who consider themselves \"subscribed\". **Interested parties must either poll the oracle to check whether the latest information has changed, or listen for updates to oracle contract and act when they occur**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include price feeds, weather information, economic or social statistics, traffic data, etc. Polling is very inefficient in the world of web servers, but not so in the peer-to-peer context of blockchain platforms: Ethereum clients have to keep up with all state changes, including changes to contract storage, so polling for data changes is a local call to a synced client. **Ethereum event logs make it particularly easy for applications to look out for oracle updates, and so this pattern can in some ways be even considered a \"push\" service. However, if the polling is done from a smart contract, which might be necessary for some decentralized applications (e.g. where activation incentives are not possible), then significant gas expenditure may be incurred.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requrest-Response Oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "**The request-response category is the most complicated: this is where the data space is too huge to be stored in a smart contract and users are expected to only need small part of the overall data set at a time**. It is also an applicable model for data provider businesses. **In practical terms, such an oracle might be implemented as a system of on-chain smart contracts and off-chain infrastructure used to monitor requests, retrieve and return data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A request for data from a decentralized application would typically be an asynchronous process involving a number of steps:\n",
    "- In this pattern, firstly, an externally-controlled account would transact with a decentralized application, resulting in an interaction with a function defined in the oracle smart contract. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- This function initiates the request to the oracle, with the associated arguments detailing the data requested in addition to supplementary information that might include callback functions and scheduling parameters. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once this transaction has been validated, the oracle request can be observed as an EVM event emitted by the oracle contract, or as a state change; the arguments can be retrieved and used to perform the actual query from the off-chain data source. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The oracle may also require payment for processing the request, gas payment for the callback, and permissions to access the requested data.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the resulting data is signed by the oracle owner, essentially attesting to the value of the data at a given time, and delivered in a transaction to the decentralized application that made the request—either directly or via the oracle contract. Depending on the scheduling parameters, the oracle may broadcast further transactions updating the data at regular intervals, e.g. end of day pricing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for a request-response oracle may be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Receiving queries from decentralized applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parsing a query\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checking that payment and data access permissions are met\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieving relevant data from an off-chain source (and encrypting if necessary)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Signing of transaction(s) with the data included\n",
    "\n",
    "- Broadcasting transactions to the network\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scheduling of any further necessary transactions, such as notifications, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "**A range of other schemes are also possible, for example, data can be requested from and returned directly by an externally-controlled account, removing the need for an oracle smart contract. Similarly, the request and response could be made to and from an Internet of Things enabled hardware sensor. Therefore, oracles can be human, software, or hardware-based.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The request-response pattern described above is commonly seen in client-server architectures. While this is a useful messaging pattern which allows applications to have a two-way conversation, it is a relatively simple pattern and perhaps inappropriate under certain conditions.** For example, a smart bond requiring an interest rate from an oracle might have to request the data on a daily basis under a request-response pattern in order to ensure the rate is always correct. Given that interest rates change infrequently, a publish-subscribe pattern may be more appropriate here—especially when taking into consideration Ethereum’s limited bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Publish–subscribe is a pattern where publishers (here, oracles) do not send messages directly to receivers, but instead categorize published messages into distinct classes. Subscribers are able to express an interest in one or more classes and retrieve only those messages which are of interest**. Under such a pattern, an oracle might write the interest rate to its own internal storage, when and only when it changes. Multiple subscribed decentralized applications can simply read it from the oracle contract, thereby reducing the impact on network bandwidth while minimizing storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a broadcast or multicast pattern, an oracle would post all messages to a channel and subscribing contracts would listen to the channel under a variety of subscription modes.** For example, an oracle might publish messages to a cryptocurrency exchange rate channel. A subscribing smart contract could request the full content of the channel if it required the time series for, e.g., a moving average calculation; another might require only the last rate for a spot price calculation. A broadcast pattern is appropriate where the oracle does not need to know the identity of the subscribing contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that the source of data being queried by a decentralized application is both authoritative and trustworthy (a not insignificant assumption), an outstanding question remains: **given that the oracle and the request-response mechanism may be operated by distinct entities, how are we able trust this mechanism? There is a distinct possibility that data may be tampered with whilst in transit, so it is critical that off-chain methods are able to attest to the returned data’s integrity**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two common approaches to data authentication are **authenticity proofs** and **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authenticity proofs are cryptographic guarantees that prove that data has not been tampered with. Based on a variety of attestation techniques (e.g. digitally signed proofs), they effectively shift the trust from the data carrier to the attestor, i.e. the provider of the attestation method**. By verifying the authenticity proof on-chain, smart contracts are able to verify the integrity of the data before operating upon it. Oraclize [1] is an example of an oracle service leveraging a variety of authenticity proofs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**One such proof that is currently available for data queries from the Ethereum main network is the TLSNotary Proof [2]. TLSNotary Proofs allow a client to provide evidence to a third party that HTTPS web traffic occurred between the client and a server**. While HTTPS is itself secure, it doesn’t support data signing. As a result, TLSNotary Proofs rely on TLSNotary (via PageSigner [3]) signatures. TLSNotary Proofs leverage the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, enabling the TLS master key, which signs the data after it has been accessed, to be split between three parties: the server (the oracle), an auditee (Oraclize), and an auditor. Oraclize uses an Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual machine instance as the auditor which can be verified as having been unmodified since instantiation [4]. This AWS instance stores the TLSNotary secret, allowing it to provide honesty proofs. Although it offers higher assurances against data tampering than a purely trusted request-response mechanism, this approach does require the assumption that Amazon itself will not tamper with the VM instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: [1], [2], [3]... are the  referrence numbers corresponding to the referrences provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TownCrier [5,6] is an authenticated data feed oracle system based on the TEE approach; such methods utilize hardware-based secure enclaves to verify data integrity**. TownCrier uses Intel’s SGX (Software Guard eXtensions) to ensure that responses from HTTPS queries can be verified as authentic. SGX provides guarantees of integrity, ensuring that applications running within an enclave are protected by the CPU against tampering by any other process. It also provides confidentiality, ensuring that an application’s state is opaque to other processes when running within the enclave. And finally, SGX allows attestation, by generating a digitally signed proof that an application—securely identified by a hash of its build—is actually running within an enclave. By verifying this digital signature, it is possible for a decentralized application to prove that a TownCrier instance is running securely within an SGX enclave. This, in turn, proves that the instance has not been tampered with and that the data emitted by TownCrier is therefore authentic. The confidentiality property additionally enables TownCrier to handle private data by allowing data queries to be encrypted using the TownCrier instance’s public key. By operating an oracle’s query/response mechanism within an enclave such as SGX, it can effectively be thought of as running securely on trusted third party hardware, ensuring that the requested data is returned untampered (assuming that we trust Intel/SGX).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computation oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only discussed oracles in the context of requesting and delivering data. **However, oracles can also be used to perform arbitrary computation, a function which can be especially useful given Ethereum’s inherent block gas limit and comparatively expensive computation costs**; with Vitalik himself pointing out the fact that the computational cost on Ethereum is less efficient by a factor of a million when compared to existing centralized services [7]. **Rather than just relaying the results of a query, computation oracles can be used to perform computation on a set of inputs and return a calculated result that may have been infeasible to calculate on-chain.** For example, one might use a computation oracle to perform a computationally-intensive regression calculation in order to estimate the yield of a bond contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are willing to trust a centralized, but auditable service, you can go again to Oraclize. They provide a service that allows decentralized applications to request the output of a computation performed in a sandboxed AWS virtual machine.** The AWS instance creates an executable container, from a user-configured Dockerfile packed in an archive that is uploaded to IPFS. On request, Oraclize retrieves this archive using its hash, and then initializes and executes the Docker container on AWS, passing any arguments that are provided to the application as environment variables. The containerized application performs the calculation, subject to a time constraint, and must have the result written to standard output where it can be retrieved by Oraclize and returned to the decentralized application. Oraclize currently offers this service on an auditable t2.micro AWS instance, so if the computation is of some non-trival value, it is possible to inspect that the correct Docker container was executed. **Nonetheless, this is not a truely decentralized solution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a '**cryptlet**' as a standard for verifiable oracle truths has been formalized as part of Microsoft’s wider ESC Framework [8]. **Cryptlets execute within an encrypted capsule that abstracts away the infrastructure, such as I/O, and has the CryptoDelegate attached so incoming and outgoing messages are signed, validated, and proven automatically**. Cryptlets support distributed transactions so that contract logic can take on complex multi-step, multi-blockchain and external system transactions in an ACID manner. This allows developers to create portable, isolated, and private resolutions of the truth for use in smart-contracts. Cryptlets follow the format below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "public class SampleContractCryptlet : Cryptlet\n",
    "  {\n",
    "        public SampleContractCryptlet(Guid id, Guid bindingId, string name, string address, IContainerServices hostContainer, bool contract)\n",
    "            : base(id, bindingId, name, address, hostContainer, contract)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            MessageApi =\n",
    "                new CryptletMessageApi(GetType().FullName, new SampleContractConstructor())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**For a more decentralized solution, we can currently turn to TrueBit [9], who offer a solution for scalable and verifiable off-chain computation. It introduces a system of solvers and verifiers, who are incentivized to perform computations and verification of those computations, respectively**. Should a solution be challenged, an iterative verification process on subsets of the computation are performed on-chain—a kind of 'verification game'. The game proceeds through a series of rounds, each recursively checking a smaller and smaller subset of the computation. The game eventually reaches a final round, where the challenge is sufficiently trivial such that the judges–Ethereum miners–can make a final ruling on whether the challenge was justified, on-chain. **In effect, TrueBit is an implementation of a computation market, allowing decentralized applications to pay for verifiable computation to be performed outside of the network, but relying on Ethereum to enforce the rules of the verification game. In theory, this enables trustless smart contracts to securely perform any computation task.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> A broad range of applications exist for systems like TrueBit, ranging from **machine learning** to verification of any proof-of-work </u>. An example of the latter is the Doge-Ethereum bridge, which utilizes TrueBit to verify Dogecoin’s proof-of-work (Scrypt), which is a memory-hard and computationally intensive function that cannot be computed within the Ethereum block gas limit. By performing this verification on TrueBit, it has been possible to securely verify Dogecoin transactions within a smart contract on Ethereum’s Rinkeby testnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decentralized oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "**While centralized data or computation oracles suffice for many applications, they do however represent central points of failure in the Ethereum network. A number of schemes have been proposed around the idea of decentralized oracles as a means of ensuring data availability, and the creation of a network of individual data providers with an on-chain data aggregation system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChainLink [10] have proposed a decentralized oracle network consisting of three key smart contracts: a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, an aggregation contract, and an off-chain registry of data providers.**\n",
    "- The reputation contract is used to keep track of data provider’s performance. Scores in the reputation contract are used to populate the off-chain registry.<br><br> \n",
    "- The order-matching contract selects bids from oracles using the reputation contract. It then finalizes a Service Level Agreement (SLA), which includes query parameters and the number of oracles required. This means that the purchaser needn’t transact with the individual oracles directly.<br><br> \n",
    "- The aggregation contract collects responses, submitted using a commit-reveal scheme, from multiple oracles, and then calculates the final collective result of the query, and finally feeds the results back into the reputation contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the main challenges with such a decentralized approach is the formulation of the aggregation function.** ChainLink proposes calculating a weighted response, allowing a validity score to be reported for each oracle response. Detecting an 'invalid' score here is non-trivial since it relies on the premise that outlying data points, measured by deviations from responses provided by peers, are incorrect. Calculating a validity score based on the location of an oracle response amongst a distribution of responses risks penalizing correct answers over average ones. Therefore, ChainLink offers a standard set of aggregation contracts, but also allows customized aggregation contracts to be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A related idea is the SchellingCoin protocol [11]. Here, multiple participants report values and the median is taken as the 'correct' answer**. Reporters are required to provide a deposit which is redistributed in favor of values that are closer to the median, therefore incentivizing the reporting of values that are similar to others. A common value, also known as the Schelling Point, which respondents might consider as the natural and obvious target around which to coordinate is expected to be close to the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teutsch recently proposed a new design for a decentralized off-chain data availability oracle [12]. This design leverages a dedicated proof-of-work blockchain which is able to correctly report on whether or not registered data is available during a given epoch. Miners attempt to download, store, and propagate all currently registered data, therefore guaranteeing data is available locally.** While such a system is expensive in the sense that every mining node stores and propagates all registered data, the system allows storage to be reused by releasing data after the registration period ends.\n",

    "# Vyper: A contract-oriented programming language\n",
    "\n",

    "**Vyper is an experimental, contract-oriented programming language which targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Vyper strives to provide superior audit-ability by simplifying code and making it readable for humans**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **One of the principles of Vyper is to make it near virtually impossible for developers to write misleading code**. This is done in a number of ways, which we will describe below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison to Solidity\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is a reference for those who are considering developing smart contracts using the Vyper programming language. **The section mainly compares and contrasts Vyper against Solidity; outlining, with sound reasoning, why Vyper does NOT include the following traditional Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifiers\n",
    "In Solidity, you can write a function using modifiers. For example, the following function called changeOwner will run the code in a modifier, called onlyBy, as part of its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function changeOwner(address _newOwner)\n",
    "    public\n",
    "    onlyBy(owner)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    owner = _newOwner;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see below, the modifier called onlyBy enforces a rule in relation to ownership. **Whilst modifiers are powerful (able to change what happens in the body of a function), they can also result in the misleading execution of code.** For example, the only way to be sure of the changeOwner function’s logic, is to inspect and test the onlyBy modifier every time our code is implemented. Obviously, if a modifier is changed in the future, the function which calls it will potentially produce a different result, than originally intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "modifier onlyBy(address _account)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    require(msg.sender == _account);\n",
    "    _;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By and large, the usual use case for a modifier is to perform single checks before a function’s execution. **Given that this is the case, Vyper’s recommendation is to do away with modifiers altogether and simply use in-line checks and asserts as part of a function**. Doing this will improve audit-ability and readability, due to the fact that the Vyper function will follow a logical in-line sequence in plain sight, rather than having to reference modifier code which has been written elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows programmers to harness pre-written code by acquiring pre-existing functionality, properties and behaviors from existing software libraries. Inheritance is powerful and promotes the reuse of code. **Solidity supports multiple inheritance as well as polymorphism, and while these are considered some of the most important features of object oriented programming, Vyper does not support them. Vyper maintains that the implementation of inheritance requires coders and auditors to jump between multiple files in order to understand what the program is doing. Vyper also understands the rules of precedence and how multiple inheritances can make code too complicated to understand**. This is a fair statement, given that the Solidity documentation on inheritance even provide an example of how multiple inheritances can be problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline assembly provides developers with an opportunity to access the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) at a low level. **When using inline assembly code (inside higher level source code) the developer is able to perform operations by directly accessing EVM opcode instructions**. For example, the following inline assembly code adds 3 at memory location 0x80 by using the EVM opcode mload.\n",
    "\n",
    "`3 0x80 mload add 0x80 mstore`\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, Vyper strives to provide developers and code auditors with the most human readable code. **Whilst inline assembly can provide powerful fine-grained control, it is not supported by the Vyper programming language.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Function overloading allows developers to write multiple functions of the same name. Each of the overloaded functions, which contain the same name, are uniquely identified by their argument signatures. Take the following two functions for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function f(uint _in) public pure returns (uint out) {\n",
    "    out = 1;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function f(uint _in, bytes32 _key) public pure returns (uint out) {\n",
    "    out = 2;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function (named f) accepts an input argument of type uint, however the second function (also named f) accepts two arguments, one of type uint and one of type bytes32. **Having multiple function definitions with the same name and different argument options could cause confusion and it is primarily for this reason that Vyper does not support function overloading.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable typecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two modalities of typecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit typecasting** is often performed at compile time. For example if a type conversion is semantically sound and no information is likely to be lost, the compiler can perform an implicit conversion, such as converting a variable of type uint8 to uint16. **Whilst the earliest versions of Vyper entertained implicit typecasting of variables, the most recent version of the Vyper programming language does not support implicit typecasting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicit typecasting** can be performed by a software developer in their source code. Unfortunately, explicit typecasting in code can often lead to unexpected behaviour. For example, if an explicit type conversion transposes a uint32 type to the smaller type of uint16, the higher-order bits are simply cut off as demonstrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "uint32 a = 0x12345678;\n",
    "uint16 b = uint16(a);\n",
    "//Variable b is 0x5678 now\n",
    "```\n",
    "**It is for this reason that Vyper has implemented a convert()function. The convert() function allows developers to perform explicit typecasting in their code.**  Choosing explicit, over implicit, typecasting means that the developer is responsible for performing the variable typecasting up front. While this approach does produce more verbose code, it also improves the safety and auditability of smart contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-conditions and post-conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vyper handles pre-conditions, post-conditions and state changes explicitly. Whilst this produces redundant code, it also allows for maximal readability and safety**. When writing a smart contract in Vyper, a developer should observe the following 3 points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, each of the 3 points should be carefully considered and then thoroughly documented in the code. Doing so will improve the design of the code, ultimately making code more readable and auditable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Condition** - What is the current state/condition of the Ethereum state variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Effects** - What effects will this smart contract code have on the condition of the state variables upon execution i.e. what WILL be affected, what WILL NOT be affected? Are these effects congruent with the smart contract’s intentions?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interaction** - Now that the first two steps have been exhaustively dealt with, it is time to run the code. Before deployment, logically step through the code and consider all of the possible permanent outcomes, consequences and scenarios of executing the code, including interactions with other contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A new programming paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "Vyper’s creation opens the door to a new programming paradigm. For example, Vyper is removing class inheritance, as well as other functionality, and therefore it can be said that Vyper is leaning away from the traditional Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, which is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically OOP has provided a mechanism for representing real world objects. For example, OOP allows the instantiation of an employee object which can inherit from a person class. However, from a value-transfer and/or smart-contract perspective, those who aspire to the functional programming paradigm would concur that transactional programming in no way lends itself to the aforementioned traditional OOP paradigm. Put simply, transactional computations are worlds apart from real world objects. For example, when was the last time you held a transaction or a forward chaining business rule in your hand?\n",
    "\n",
    "**It seems that Vyper is not fully aligned with either the OOP paradigm or the functional programming paradigm (the full list of reasons is beyond the scope of this chapter). For this reason, could we be so bold, at this early stage of development, to coin a new software development paradigm? One which endevours to future proof blockchain executable code. One which prevents the catastrophic loss of funds in an immutable setting**. Past events experienced in the blockchain revolution are organically creating new opportunities for further research and development in this space. Perhaps the outcomes of such research and development could eventually result in a new immutability paradigm classification for software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Online code editor and compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "Vyper has its own online code editor and compiler at the following URL: https://vyper.online. This Vyper online compiler allows you to write and then compile your smart contracts into Bytecode, ABI and LLL using only your web browser. The Vyper online compiler has a variety of prewritten smart contracts for your convenience. These include a simple open auction, safe remote purchases, ERC20 token and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling using the command line\n",
    "Each Vyper contract is saved in a single file with the .v.py extension. Once installed Vyper can compile and provide bytecode by running the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "`vyper ~/hello_world.v.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The human readable ABI code (in JSON format) can be obtained by then running the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "`vyper -f json ~/hello_world.v.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protecting against overflow errors at the compiler level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overflow errors in software can be catastrophic when dealing with real value. This transaction shows the malicious transfer of over 57,896,044,618,658,100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 BEC tokens. The transaction, which occured in mid April of 2018, is the result of an integer overflow issue in BeautyChain’s ERC20 token contract (BecToken.sol)**. Solidity developers do have libraries like SafeMath as well as Ethereum smart contract security analysis tools like Mythril. However, unfortunately in cases such as the aforementioned BEC token contract situation, developers are not forced to use the safety tools. **Put simply, if safety is not enforced, developers are still able to write arbitrary code (outside of the help provided) which can then be successfully compiled and later on successfully executed. Even if the outcome is detrimental.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vyper strives to provide overflow protection which is actually built into the programming language. Vyper’s built-in functionality, which provides protection against overflow errors, is implemented in a two prong approach.**\n",
    "- Firstly Vyper provides a SafeMath equivalent which includes the necessary exception cases for integers arithmetic. \n",
    "- In addition to this, Vyper also uses clamps which are enforced whenever a literal constant is loaded, a value is passed into a function, or when a variable is assigned. Clamps are implemented via custom functions in the Low-level Lisp-like Language (LLL) compiler. The safety measures that the clamps provide via LLL can not be turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Vyper, the LLL layer serves an Intermediate Representation (IR). This IR layer (which is conducive for further processing) actually sits between the Vyper source code (which the developer writes) and the bytecode (which the EVM executes). Therefore, **developers who code and compile using the Vyper programming language will automatically be protected against integer overflow issues.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading and writing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart contracts can write data to two places, Ethereum’s global state trie or Ethereum’s chain data. **While it is costly to store, read and modify data, these storage operations are a necessary component of most smart contracts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global state**\n",
    "The state variables in a given smart contract are stored in Ethereum’s global state trie, a given smart contract can only store, read and modify data specifically in relation to that contract’s address (i.e. smart contracts can not read or write to other smart contracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log**\n",
    "As previously mentioned, a smart contract can also write to Ethereum’s chain data through log events. While Vyper initially employed the __log__ syntax for declaring these events, an update has been made which brings Vyper’s event declaration more in line with Solidity’s original syntax. For example, Vyper’s declaration of an event called MyLog was originally `MyLog: __log__({arg1: indexed(bytes[3])})` Vyper’s syntax has now become `MyLog: event({arg1: indexed(bytes[3])})`. It is important to note that the execution of the log event in Vyper was, and still is, as follows `log.MyLog(\"123\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While smart contracts can write to Ethereum’s chain data (through log events), smart contracts are unable to read the on-chain log events, which they created. Notwithstanding, one of the advantages of writing to Ethereum’s chain data via log events is that logs can be discovered and read, on the public chain, by light clients. For example, the logsBloom value in a mined block can indicate whether or not a log event was present. Once this has been established the log data can be obtained through the path of logs → data inside a given transaction receipt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ERC20 token interface implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vyper has implemented ERC20 as a precompiled contract; allowing these smart contracts to be easily used by default. Contracts in Vyper must be declared as global variables**. An example for declaring the ERC20 variable is as follows.\n",
    "`token: address(ERC20)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## OPCODES\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for smart contracts is mainly written in high level languages like Solidity or Vyper. The compiler is responsible for taking the high level code and creating the lower level interpretation of it, which is then executable on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). **The lowest representation the compiler can distill the code to (prior to execution by the EVM) are opcodes. This being the case, each implementation of a high level language (like Vyper) is required to provide an appropriate compilation mechanism (a compiler) to allow (among other things) the high level code to be compiled into the universally predefined EVM opcodes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The origin of Ethereum opcodes is of course the Ethereum Yellow Paper. Each implementation of the Ethereum opcodes can be found in the appropriate source code repository**. For example Solidity’s C++ opcode implementation can be found in the Instructions.cpp file and Vyper’s Python opcode implementation can be found in the opcodes.py file.\n",

    "# Ethereum Fork History\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most hard forks are planned as part of an upgrade roadmap and consist of updates that the community generally agrees to (i.e. consensus on the social level). However, some hard forks do not always retain consensus which leads to multiple, distinct blockchains**. The events that lead to the Ethereum / Ethereum Classic split is one such case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum Classic came to be after members of the Ethereum community went ahead with a time-sensitive hard fork (\"DAO Hard Fork\"). **On 25th July 2016, at a block height of 1.92 million, Ethereum introduced an irregular state change via a hard-fork in an effort to return approximately 3.6 million ether that had been taken from a smart contract known as The DAO.** Almost everyone agreed that the ether taken had been stolen and that leaving it all in the hands of the thief would be of significant detriment to development of the Ethereum ecosystem as well as the platform itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning the ether to its respective owners before The DAO even existed was technically easy, if rather politically controversial. **A number of people in the ecosystem disagreed with this change, believing immutability should be a fundamental principle of the Ethereum blockchain without exception; they elected to continue the original chain under the name of Ethereum Classic**. While the split itself was initially ideological both chains have since evolved into their own separate entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (The DAO)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The DAO was created by Slock with the goal to provide community-based funding and governance for projects. The core idea of it being that proposals would be submitted, curators would manage proposals, funds would be raised from investors within the Ethereum community, and if the project proves successful then investors would receive a share of the profits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The DAO was also one of the first experiments in an Ethereum token. Rather than funding projects directly with Ether, participants would trade their ether for DAO tokens, use them to vote on project funding, and would later be able to trade them back for Ether.**\n",
    "\n",
    "DAO tokens were able to be purchased in a crowdsale that ran from 5th April through 30th April 2016, amassing nearly 14% <<[1]>> of the total ether in existence which was worth 150 million USD at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Re-Entrancy Bug\n",
    "\n",
    "On 9th June, developers Peter Vessenes and Chriseth reported that most Ethereum-based contracts which manage funds are potentially vulnerable to an exploit <<[2]>> that can empty contract funds. A few days later (12th June) Stephen Tual (Co-founder of Slock.It), reported that The DAO’s code is not vulnerable <<[3]>> to the bug described by Peter and Chriseth. Worried DAO contributors temporarily breathe a sigh of relief until 5 days later, **when an unknown attacker (\"the DAO Attacker\") started draining The DAO <<[4]>> using an exploit similar to the one described on 9th June. Ultimately the DAO Attacker siphoned ~3.6 million ether out of The DAO.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simultaneously an assemblage of volunteers calling themselves the Robinhood Group (RHG) started using the same exploit to withdraw the remaining funds in order to save them from being stolen by the DAO Attacker. On the 21st June, the RHG announced <<[5]>> that they’ve secured the about 70% of The DAO’s funds (roughly 7.2 million ether), with plans to return it to the community (which they successfully did on the ETC network, and didn’t need to do on the Ethereum network post fork).** Much thanks and commendations are given to the RHG for their quick thinking and fast actions that helped secure the bulk of the community’s ether.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-Entrancy Technicals\n",
    "\n",
    "While a more detailed and thorough explanation of the bug is described by Phil Daian <<[6]>> **the short explanation is that a crucial function in the DAO had two lines of code in the wrong order, meaning that the Attacker could have requests to withdraw ether acted upon repeatedly, before the check of whether the Attacker was entitled to the withdraw was completed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-Entrancy Attack Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you had 100 USD in your bank account and you could bring your bank teller any number of withdrawal slips. The bank teller gives you money for each slip in order, and only at the end of all the slips do they record your withdrawal. What if you brought them three slips to each withdraw 100 USD? What if you brought them three thousand?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Put another way, the flow was:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DAO Attacker asks the DAO Contract to withdraw DAO tokens (DAO).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DAO Attacker asks the contract to withdraw DAO again. Before the contract updates its records that DAO was withdrawn.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat step two as much as possible.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Contract finally logs a single DAO withdrawal, losing track of the withdrawals that happened in the interim.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The DAO Hard Fork\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fortunately, there were several safe guards built into The DAO: all withdrawal requests were subject to a 28 day delay. This gave the community a short timeframe to discuss what to do about the exploit. From roughly 17th June to 20th July the DAO Attacker would be unable to convert their DAO tokens into Ether.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several developers focused on finding a viable solution and multiple avenues were explored in this short space of time. Among them was:\n",
    "- the **DAO Soft Fork**, announced on 24th June, to delay DAO withdrawals until consensus was reached <<[7]>>,\n",
    "- and a **DAO Hard Fork**, announced on 15th July, to reverse the effects of the DAO Attack with an exceptional state change <<[8]>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On 28th June, developers discovered a DoS exploit in the DAO Soft Fork <<[9]>>, and concluded that the DAO Hard Fork would be the only viable option to fully resolve the situation. The DAO Hard Fork would transfer all ether that had been invested in the DAO into a new refund smart contract, allowing the original owners of the ether to claim a full refund**. This provided a solution for returning the hacked funds but also meant interfering with the balances of specific addresses on the network; however isolated they were. There would also be some leftover ether in portions of The DAO known as childDAOs <<[12]>>. A group of trustees would manually authorize the leftover ether; worth 6-7 million USD at the time <<[8]>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "With time running out, multiple Ethereum development teams created clients that allowed a user to decide whether they wanted to enable this fork. However, the client creators wanted to decide whether to make this choice opt-in (don’t fork by default), or opt-out (fork by default). On the 15th July, a vote was opened on carbonvote.com <<[10]>>. The next day, at block height 1,894,000 <<[11]>> it was closed. Of the 5.5 percent of the total ether supply that voted, ~80 percent of the votes (~4.5 percent of the total ether supply) voted for opt-out. One quarter of the opt-out vote came from a single address <<[12]>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately the decision became opt-out, and those who opposed the DAO Hard Fork would need to explicitly state that they opposed by changing a configuration option in the software they were running.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On the 20th July, at block height 1,920,000** <<[13]>> **Ethereum implemented the DAO Hard Fork** <<[14]>> **and thus two Ethereum networks were created, one including the state change, and the other ignoring it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When the DAO Hard Forked Ethereum (present-day Ethereum) gained a majority of the mining power, many assumed that consensus was achieved and the minority chain would fade away; as in previous forks. Despite this, a sizable portion of the Ethereum community (roughly 10 percent by value and mining power) started supporting the non-forked chain which came to be known as Ethereum Classic with the symbol ETC.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within days, several exchanges began to list both Ethereum (\"ETH\") and Ethereum Classic (\"ETC\"). **Due to the nature of hard forks, all Ethereum users holding ether at the time of the split then held funds on both of the chains** and a market value for ETC was soon established with Poloniex listing ETC on the 24th July <<[15]>>\n",

    "\n",
    "**While the initial split was centered around The DAO, the two networks, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are now separate projects, although most development is still done by the Ethereum community and simply ported to Ethereum Classic codebases.** Nevertheless, the full set of differences is constantly evolving and too extensive to cover in this section. **However, it is worth noting that the chains do differ significantly in their core development and community structure.**\n",

    "### Technical Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EVM**<br>\n",
    "For the most part (as of April 2018) the two networks remain highly compatible. **Contract code produced for one chain runs as expected on the other, but there are some small differences in EVM OPCODES** (see EIPs 140, 145, and 214).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Network Development**<br>.\n",
    "Being open projects, most blockchain platforms ultimately have many users and contributors. However, the core network development (code that runs the network) is often done by discrete groups due to the expertise and knowledge required to develop this type of software.

    "Within the context of blockchains, immutability refers to the preservation of blockchain history.\n",
