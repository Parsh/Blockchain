    "# What is Ethereum?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum is \"the World Computer\"**. That’s one of the more common descriptions of the Ethereum platform. But what does that mean? Let’s try to start with a computer science focused description, and then try to decipher that with a more practical analysis of Ethereum’s capabilities and characteristics, while comparing it to Bitcoin and other **decentralized information exchange platforms (or \"blockchains\" for short)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a computer science perspective, **Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state-machine with two basic functions**: \n",
    "- the first being **a globally accessible singleton state**, and\n",
    "- the second being **a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.**\n",
    "\n",
    "From a more practical perspective, **Ethereum is an open-source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called \"smart contracts\". It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system \"state\" changes, along with a cryptocurrency called \"ether\" to meter and constrain execution resource costs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Ethereum platform **enables developers to build powerful decentralized applications with built-in economic functions**. While providing continuous uptime, it also reduces or eliminates censorship, third party interface, and counterparty risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people will come to Ethereum with some prior experience of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin. <br>**Ethereum shares many common elements with other open blockchains**:\n",
    "- a peer-to-peer network connecting participants, \n",
    "- a byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus algorithm for synchronization of state updates (a proof-of-work blockchain), and \n",
    "- a digital currency (ether).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of a blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of an open, public, blockchain are (usually):\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **peer-to-peer network** connecting participants and propagating transactions and blocks of verified transactions, based on a standardized \"gossip\" protocol.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Messages, in the form of transactions**, representing state transitions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A set of **consensus rules**, governing what constitutes a transaction and what makes for valid state transition.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **state machine** that processes transactions according to the consensus rules.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **chain of cryptographically secured blocks**, that acts as a journal of all the verified and accepted state transitions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **consensus algorithm** that decentralizes control over the blockchain, by forcing participants to cooperate in the enforcement of the consensus rules.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **game-theoretically sound incentivization scheme** (e.g. proof-of-work costs plus block rewards) to economically secure the state machine in an open environment.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- One or more **open-source software implementations of the above (\"clients\")**.\n",
    "\n",
    "All or most of these components are usually combined in a single software client. For example, in Bitcoin, the reference implementation is developed by the Bitcoin Core open source project, and implemented as the **bitcoind client**.<br>\n",
    "**In Ethereum, rather than a reference implementation, there is a \"reference specification\", a mathematical description of the system in the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)**. There are a number of clients, which are built according to the reference specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, <u>we used the term \"blockchain\" to represent all of the components above, as a short-hand reference to the combination of technologies that encompass all of the characteristics described </u>. Today, however, **the term blockchain has become diluted by marketers and profiteers**, looking to hype their projects and attain unrealistic valuations for their startups. It is effectively meaningless on its own. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**We need qualifiers to help us understand the characteristics of the blockchain in question, such as open, public, global, decentralized, neutral, and censorship-resistant,** to identify the important emergent characteristics of a \"blockchain\" system that these components allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Not all blockchains are created equal</u>. **When you are told that something is a blockchain, you have not received an answer; rather, you need to start asking a lot of questions to clarify what they mean when they use the word \"blockchain\"**. Start by asking for a description of the components above, then ask about whether this \"blockchain\" exhibits the characteristics of being open, public, etc..?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development of Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, both the purpose and construction of Ethereum are strikingly different from the open blockchains that preceded it, including Bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum’s purpose is not primarily a digital currency payment network. While the digital currency ether is both integral and necessary for the operation of Ethereum, ether is intended as a utility currency to pay for use of the Ethereum platform as the \"World Computer\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Bitcoin, which has a very limited scripting language, <u>Ethereum is designed to be a general purpose programmable blockchain that runs a virtual machine capable of executing code of arbitrary and unbounded complexity</u>. Where Bitcoin’s Script language is, intentionally, constrained to simple true/false evaluation of spending conditions, **Ethereum’s language is Turing Complete, meaning that it is equivalent to a general purpose computer that can run any computation that a theoretical Turing Machine can run.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Birth of Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "All great innovations solve real problems, Ethereum is no exception. Ethereum was conceived at a time when people recognized the power of the Bitcoin model, and were trying to move beyond cryptocurrency applications and into other projects. But developers faced a conundrum: they either needed to build on top of Bitcoin or start a new blockchain. **Building upon Bitcoin meant living within the intentional constraints of the network and trying to find workarounds. The limited types and sizes of data storage seemed to limit the types of applications that could run on top, as second layer solutions**. Programmers needed to build systems that utilized only the limited set of variables, transaction types, and data. **For projects that needed more freedom, more flexibility, starting a new blockchain was the only option. But starting a new blockchain meant a lot of work: bootstrapping all the infrastructure elements, exhaustive testing, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end of 2013, Vitalik Buterin, a young programmer and Bitcoin enthusiast, started thinking about further extending the capabilities of Bitcoin and Mastercoin (an overlay protocol that extended Bitcoin to offer rudimentary smart contracts). In October of 2013, Vitalik proposed a more generalized approach to the Mastercoin team, one that allowed flexible and scriptable (but not Turing complete) contracts to replace the specialized contract language of Mastercoin. While the Mastercoin team was impressed, this proposal was too radical a change to fit into their development roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In December 2013, Vitalik started sharing a white paper which outlined the idea behind Ethereum: a Turing complete programmable and general purpose blockchain. A few dozen people saw this early draft and offered feedback to Vitalik, helping him gradually evolve the proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the authors of this book received an early draft copy of the white paper and commented on it. Andreas M. Antonopoulos was intrigued by the idea and asked Vitalik many questions about the use of a separate blockchain to enforce consensus rules on smart contract execution and the implications of a Turing complete language. Andreas continued to follow Ethereum’s progress with great interest but was in the early stages of writing his book \"Mastering Bitcoin\" and did not participate directly in Ethereum until much later. Dr. Gavin Wood, however, was one of the first people to reach out to Vitalik and offer to help with his C++ programming skills. Gavin became Ethereum’s co-founder, co-designer and CTO.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Vitalik recounts in his \"Ethereum Prehistory\" post:<br>\n",
    "This was the time when the Ethereum protocol was entirely my own creation. From here on, however, new participants started to join the fold. By far the most prominent on the protocol side was Gavin Wood. **Gavin can also be largely credited for the subtle change in vision from viewing Ethereum as a platform for building programmable money, with blockchain-based contracts that can hold digital assets and transfer them according to pre-set rules, to a general-purpose computing platform.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This started with subtle changes in emphasis and terminology, and <u>later this influence became stronger with the increasing emphasis on the “Web 3” ensemble, which saw Ethereum as being one piece of a suite of decentralized technologies, the other two being Whisper and Swarm.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in December 2013, Vitalik and Gavin refined and evolved the idea, together building the protocol layer that became Ethereum. **Ethereum’s founders were thinking about a blockchain that didn’t aim for a specific purpose, but instead could support a broad variety of applications by being programmed.** \n",
    "> **The idea was that by using a general purpose blockchain like Ethereum, a developer could program their particular application without having to bootstrap the underlying mechanisms of peer-to-peer networks, blockchains, consensus algorithms, etc.** <u>The Ethereum platform was designed to abstract these details and provide a deterministic and secure programming environment for decentralized blockchain applications</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like Satoshi, Vitalik and Gavin didn’t just invent a new technology, they combined new inventions with existing technologies in a novel way and delivered the prototype code to prove their ideas to the world. The founders worked for years, building and refining the vision. And on July 30th 2015, the first Ethereum block was mined. The world’s computer started serving the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vitalik Buterin’s article \"A Prehistory of Ethereum\" was published in September 2017 and provides a fascinating first-person view of Ethereum’s earliest moments. Read it at https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum’s four stages of development\n",
    "\n",
    "The birth of Ethereum was the launch of the first stage, named \"Frontier\". **Ethereum’s development is planned over four distinct stages, with major changes occurring in each new stage. Each stage may include sub-releases, known as \"hard forks\" that change functionality in a way that is not backwards compatible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main development stages are codenamed **Frontier**, **Homestead**, **Metropolis** and **Serenity**. The intermediate hard forks are codenamed \"**Ice Age**\", \"**DAO**\", \"**Tangerine Whistle**\", \"**Spurious Dragon**\", \"**Byzantium**\", and \"**Constantinople**\". They are listed below, by the block number in which the hard fork occurred:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Past transitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #0<br>\n",
    "**\"Frontier\"** - The initial stage of Ethereum, lasted from July 30th 2015 to March 2016.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #200,000<br>\n",
    "\"Ice Age\" - A hard fork to introduce an exponential difficulty increase, to motivate a transition to Proof-of-Stake when ready.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #1,150,000<br>\n",
    "**\"Homestead\"** - The second stage of Ethereum, launched in March 2016.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #1,192,000<br>\n",
    "\"DAO\" - The hard fork that reimbursed victims of the hacked DAO contract and caused Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to split into two competing systems.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #2,463,000<br>\n",
    "\"Tangerine Whistle\" - A hard fork to change the gas calculation for certain IO-heavy operations and to clear the accumulated state from a denial of service attack, which exploited the low gas cost of those operations.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #2,675,000<br>\n",
    "\"Spurious Dragon\" - A hard fork to address more denial of service attack vectors, and another state clearing. Also, a replay attack protection mechanism.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current state**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are currently in the Metropolis stage, which was planned as two sub-release hard forks codenamed **Byzantium** and **Constantinople**. Byzantium went into effect in October 2017 and Constantinople is anticipated by mid-2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block #4,370,000<br>\n",
    "**\"Metropolis Byzantium\"** - Metropolis is the third stage of Ethereum, launched in October 2017. Byzantium is the first of two hard forks for Metropolis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future plans**\n",
    "\n",
    "After Metropolis' Byzantium hard fork, there is one more hard fork planned for Metropolis. Metropolis is followed by the final stage of Ethereum’s deployment, codenamed Serenity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constantinople: The second part of the Metropolis stage, planned for mid-2018. Expected to include a switch to hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm, among other changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Serenity**: The fourth and final stage of Ethereum. Serenity does not yet have a planned release date.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum: A general purpose blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "The original blockchain, namely Bitcoin’s blockchain, tracks the state of units of bitcoin and their ownership. \n",
    "> **We can think of bitcoin as a distributed consensus state machine, where transactions cause a global state transition, altering the ownership of coins**. The state transitions are constrained by the rules of consensus, allowing all participants to (eventually) converge on a common (consensus) state of the system, after several blocks are mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum is also a distributed state machine. But instead of tracking only the state of currency ownership, Ethereum tracks the state transitions of a general-purpose data store. By general purpose we mean any data that can be expressed as a key-value tuple.** A key-value data store simply stores any arbitrary value, referenced by some key. For example, storing the value \"Mastering Ethereum\", referenced by the key \"Book Title\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum VS General purpose Computers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarities:<br>\n",
    "- In some ways, tracking the state transitions of a general-purpose data store serves the same purpose as the data storage model of Random Access Memory (RAM) used by a general purpose computer. **Ethereum has memory that stores both code and data and it uses the Ethereum blockchain to track how this memory changes over time**.\n",
    "- Like a general-purpose stored-program computer, **Ethereum can load code into its state machine and run that code, storing the resulting state changes in its blockchain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:<br>\n",
    "Two of the critical differences from a general purpose computer are that \n",
    "- Ethereum **state changes are governed by the rules of consensus**\n",
    "- the **state is distributed globally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum answers the question:<br> **\"What if we could track any arbitrary state and program the state machine to create a world-wide computer operating under consensus?\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethereum’s components\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ethereum, the components of a blockchain system described in [Components of a blockchain](#Components-of-a-blockchain) are, more specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P2P Network**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum runs on the Ethereum Main Network, which is addressable on TCP port 30303, and runs a protocol called **ÐΞVp2p**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consensus rules**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum’s consensus rules, defined in the reference specification, the Ethereum Yellow Paper.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transactions**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum transactions are network messages, that include (among other things) a sender, recipient, value and data payload.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Machine**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum state transitions are processed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a stack-based virtual machine that executes bytecode (machine-language instructions). EVM programs, called \"**smart contracts**\", are written in high-level languages (e.g. **Solidity**) and compiled to bytecode for execution on the EVM.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Structures**<br>\n",
    "<u>Ethereum’s state is stored locally on each node as a database (usually Google’s LevelDB)</u>, which contains the transactions and system state in a serialized hashed data structure called a Merkle Patricia Tree.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consensus Algorithm**<br>\n",
    "<u>Ethereum uses Nakamoto Consensus, i.e. Bitcoin’s consensus model</u>, which uses sequential single-signature blocks, weighted in importance by the Proof-of-Work to determine the longest chain and therefore the current state. However, **there are plans to move to a Proof-of-Stake weighted voting system, codenamed Casper in the near future**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Economic Security**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum currently uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm called **Ethash**, but this will eventually be dropped with the move Proof-of-Stake at some point in the future.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clients**<br>\n",
    "Ethereum has several interoperable implementations of the client software, the most prominent of which are **Go-Ethereum (Geth)** and **Parity**.\n",

    "## Ethereum and Turing Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you start reading about Ethereum, you will immediately hear the term \"Turing Complete\". **Ethereum, they say, unlike Bitcoin, is \"Turing Complete\"**. What exactly does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"Turing Complete\" is named after English mathematician Alan Turing who is considered the father of computer science. **In 1936 he created a mathematical model of a computer consisting of a state machine that manipulates symbols, by reading and writing them on sequential memory (resembling an infinite-length magnetic tape)**. With this construct, Alan Turing went on to provide a mathematical foundation to answer (in the negative) questions about universal computability, meaning whether all problems are solvable. **He proved that there are classes of problems that are uncomputable**. Specifically, he proved that the Halting Problem (trying to evaluate whether a program will eventually stop running) is not solvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alan Turing further defined a system to be Turing Complete, if it can be used to simulate any Turing Machine. Such a system is called a **Universal Turing Machine** (UTM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum’s ability to execute a stored program, in a state machine called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, while reading and writing data to memory makes it a Turing Complete system and therefore a Universal Turing Machine**. Ethereum can compute any algorithm that can be computed by any Turing Machine, given the limitations of finite memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ethereum’s groundbreaking innovation is to combine the general-purpose computing architecture of a stored-program computer with a decentralized blockchain, thereby creating a distributed single-state (singleton) world computer**.<br> Ethereum programs run \"everywhere\", yet produce a common (consensus) state that is secured by the rules of consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turing Completeness as a \"feature\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hearing that Ethereum is Turing Complete, you might arrive at the conclusion that this is a feature that is somehow lacking in a system that is Turing Incomplete. Rather, it is the opposite. Turing Completeness is, in some ways, very easy to achieve.** Turing completeness arises in even the simplest state machines. In fact the simplest Turing Complete state machine known (Rogozhin, 1996) has 4 states and uses 6 symbols, with a state definition that is only 22 instructions long. Indeed, sometimes systems are found to be \"Accidentally Turing Complete\". A fun reference of systems that are \"Accidentally Turing Complete\" can be found here: http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/articles/accidentally_turing_complete.html\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **Turing Completeness is very dangerous, particularly in openly accessible systems, like public blockchains**, because of the Halting Problem we touched on earlier. For example, modern printers are Turing Complete and can be given files to print that send them into a frozen state.<br>\n",
    "**The fact that Ethereum is Turing Complete means that any program of any complexity can be computed in Ethereum. But that flexibility brings some thorny security and resource management problems**. An unresponsive printer can be turned off and turned back on again. That is not possible with a public blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications of Turing Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Turing proved that you cannot predict whether a program will terminate, by simulating it on a computer. In simple terms, we cannot predict the path of a program without running it**. Turing Complete systems can run in \"infinite loops\", a term used (in oversimplification) to describe a program that does not terminate. It is trivial to create a program that runs a loop that never ends. But unintended never-ending loops can arise without warning, due to complex interactions between the starting conditions and the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Ethereum, this poses a challenge: every participating node (client), must validate every transaction, running any smart contracts it calls. But as Turing proved, **Ethereum can’t predict if a smart contract will terminate, or how long it will run, without actually running it (possibly running forever)**. Whether by accident, or on purpose, a smart contract can be created such that it runs forever when a node attempts to validate it. **This is effectively a denial of service attack. Of course, between a program that takes a millisecond to validate and one that runs forever there is an infinite range of nasty, resource hogging, memory-bloating, CPU overheating programs that simply waste resources. In a world computer, a program that abuses resources gets to abuse the world’s resources**. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does Ethereum constrain the resources used by a smart contract if it cannot predict resource use in advance?\n",
    ">To answer this challenge, Ethereum introduces a metering mechanism called **gas**. As the EVM executes a smart contract, it carefully accounts for every instruction (computation, data access, etc.). **Each instruction has a pre-determined cost in units of gas. When a transaction triggers the execution of a smart contract, it must include an amount of gas that sets the upper limit of computation that can be consumed running the smart contract. The EVM will terminate execution if the amount of gas consumed by computation exceeds the gas available in the transaction. Gas is the mechanism Ethereum uses to allow Turing Complete computation while limiting the resources that any program can consume.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question is, **'how does one get gas to pay for computation on the Ethereum world computer?'**.\n",
    "> You won’t find gas on any exchanges. **Gas can only be purchased as part of a transaction, and can only be bought with Ether. Ether needs to be sent along with a transaction and it needs to be explicitly ear-marked for the purchase of gas, along with an acceptable gas price**. Just like at the pump station, <u>the price of gas is not fixed</u>. Gas is purchased for the transaction, the computation is executed, and any unused gas is refunded back to the sender of transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that is in direct contrast to Bitcoin, where any series of available scripting functions (and there are not many) can be included in a transaction, as long as the size of the transaction, in bytes, fits the restrictions in place at the time of the transaction. This means that Bitcoin is vulnerable to attack from 'execution bomb' transactions, such as the infamous \"three minute tx\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015 an **attacker exploited an EVM instruction that cost far less gas than it should have**. This allowed the attacker to create transactions that use a lot of memory and take several minutes to validate. **To fix this attack, Ethereum had to change its gas accounting formula for certain instructions in a backwards incompatible (hard fork) change.** Even with this change, however, Ethereum clients have to skip validating these transactions or waste weeks trying to validate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From general purpose blockchains to Decentralized Applications (DApps)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum started as a way to make a general purpose blockchain that could be programmed for a variety of uses. But very quickly, Ethereum’s vision expanded to become a platform for programming Decentralized Applications (DApps)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "DApps represent a broader perspective than \"smart contracts\". **A DApp is, at the very least, a smart contract and a web user-interface. More broadly, a DApp is a web application that is built on top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DApp is composed of at least:\n",
    "- **Smart contracts** on a blockchain.\n",
    "- A **web front-end user-interface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, many DApps include other decentralized components, such as:\n",
    "- A decentralized (P2P) storage protocol and platform.\n",
    "- A decentralized (P2P) messaging protocol and platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You may see DApps spelled as **ÐApps**. The Ð character is the Latin character called \"ETH\", alluding to Ethereum. To display this character, use decimal entity #208 in HTML, and Unicode characters 0xCE (UTF-8), or 0x00D0 (UTF-16).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Third Age of the Internet - WEB 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2004, the term \"Web 2.0\" came to prominence, describing an evolution of the web towards user-generated content, responsive interfaces and interactivity. Web 2.0 is not a technical specification, but rather a term describing the new focus of web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The concept of DApps is meant to take the World Wide Web to its next natural evolution, introducing decentralization with peer-to-peer protocols into every aspect of a web application**. The term used to describe this evolution is **Web3**, meaning the third \"version\" of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "First proposed by Gavin Wood, **web3 represents a new vision and focus for web applications: from centrally owned and managed applications, to applications built on decentralized protocols.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Later we’ll explore the **Ethereum web3.js JavaScript library which bridges JavaScript applications that run in your browser with the Ethereum blockchain**. The web3.js library also includes:\n",
    "- an interface to a P2P storage network called **Swarm** and\n",
    "- an interface to a P2P messaging service called **Whisper**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these three components included in a JavaScript library running in your web browser, developers have a full application development suite that allows them to build web3 DApps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Web3Suite.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum’s development culture\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we’ve talked about how Ethereum’s goals and technology differ from other blockchains that preceded it, like Bitcoin. Ethereum also has a very different development culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Bitcoin, development is guided by very conservative principles: all changes are carefully studied to ensure that none of the existing systems are disrupted. For the most part, changes are only implemented if they are backwards compatible**. Existing clients are allowed to \"opt-in\", but will continue to operate if they decide not to upgrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Ethereum, by comparison, the development culture is focused on the future rather than the past. The (not entirely serious) mantra is \"move fast and break things\". If a change is needed, it is implemented, even if that means invalidating prior assumptions, breaking compatibility, or forcing clients to update. Ethereum’s development culture is characterized by rapid innovation, rapid evolution and a willingness to deploy forward-looking improvements, even if this is at the expense of some backwards incompatibility.**\n",

    "What this means to you as a developer, is that you must remain flexible and be prepared to rebuild your infrastructure as some of the underlying assumptions change. **One of the big challenges facing developers in Ethereum is the inherent contradiction between deploying code to an immutable system and a development platform that is still evolving. You can’t simply \"upgrade\" your smart contracts. You must be prepared to deploy new ones, migrate users, apps and funds, and start over.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Ironically, this also means that the goal of building systems with more autonomy and less centralized control is still not fully realized</u>. Autonomy and decentralization requires a bit more stability in the platform than you’re likely to get in Ethereum in the next few years. **In order to \"evolve\" the platform, you have to be ready to scrap and restart your smart contracts, which means you have to retain a certain degree of control over them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**But, on the positive side, Ethereum is moving forward very fast**. There’s very little opportunity for \"**bike-shedding**\" - an expression that means holding up development by arguing over minor details such as how to build the bicycle shed at the back of a nuclear power station. If you start bike-shedding, you might suddenly discover the rest of the development team changed the plan, and ditched bicycles in favor of autonomous hovercrafts.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Eventually, the development of the Ethereum platform slow down and its interfaces will become fixed. **But in the meantime, innovation is the driving principle. You’d better keep up, because no one will slow down for you.**\n",

    "## Why learn Ethereum?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blockchains have a very steep learning curve, as they combine multiple disciplines into one domain: programming, information security, cryptography, economics, distributed systems, peer-to-peer networks etc. Ethereum makes this learning curve a lot less steep, so you can get started very quickly**. But just below the surface of a deceptively simple environment, lies a lot more. As you learn and start looking deeper, there’s always another layer of complexity and wonder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum is a great platform for learning about blockchains and it’s building a massive community of developers, faster than any other blockchain platform. **More than any other blockchain, Ethereum is a developer’s blockchain, built by developers, for developers**. A developer familiar with JavaScript applications can drop into Ethereum and start producing working code very quickly. For the first years of Ethereum, it was common to see t-shirts announcing that you can create a token in just five lines of code. Of course, this is a double-edged sword. **It’s easy to write code, but it’s very hard to write good and secure code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook will teach you?\n",

    "This notebook dives into Ethereum and examines every component. We will start with a simple transaction, dissect how it works, build a simple contract, make it better and follow its journey through the Ethereum system.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Control and responsibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open blockchains like Ethereum are important because they operate as a decentralized system. That means lots of things, but one crucial aspect is that each user of Ethereum can—and should—control their own private keys, which are the things that control access to funds and smart contracts.** We sometimes call the combination of access to funds and smart contracts an \"**account**\" or \"**wallet**\". These terms can get quite complex in their functionality, so we will go into this in more detail later. As a fundamental principle, however, it is as easy as one private key equals one \"account\". Some users choose to give up control over their private keys by using a third party custodian, such as an online exchange. Here, we will learn you how to take control and manage your own private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With control comes a big responsibility. If you lose your private keys, you lose access to funds and contracts**. No one can help you regain access—your funds will be locked forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a **few tips to help you manage this responsibility**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not improvise security. Use tried-and-tested standard approaches.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The more important the account (e.g. the higher the value of the funds controlled, or the more significant the smart contracts accessible), the higher security measures should be taken.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The highest security is gained from an air-gapped device, but this level is not required for every account.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Never store your private key in plain form, especially digitally. Fortunately, most user interfaces today won’t even let you see the raw private key.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Private keys can be stored in an encrypted form, as a digital \"keystore\" file. Being encrypted, they need a password to unlock. When you are prompted to choose a password, make it strong (i.e. long and random), back it up and don’t share it. If you don’t have a password manager, write it down and store it in a safe and secret place. To access your account, you need both the \"keystore\" file and the password.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not store any passwords in digital documents, digital photos, screenshots, online drives, encrypted PDFs, etc. Again, do not improvise security. Use a password manager or pen and paper.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you are prompted to back up a key as a mnemonic word sequence, use pen and paper to make a physical backup. Do not leave that task for \"later\"; you will forget. These can be used to rebuild your private key in case you lose all data saved on your system, or if you forget or lose your password. However, they can also be used by attackers to get your private keys, and so never store them digitally, and keep the physical copy stored securely in a locked drawer or safe.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before transferring any large amounts (especially to new addresses), first do a small test transaction (e.g. less than 1 USD value) and wait for confirmation of receipt.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you create a new account, start by sending only a small test transaction to the new address. Once you receive the test transaction, try sending back again from that account. There are lots of reasons account creation can go wrong, and if it has gone wrong, it is better to find out with a small loss. If sending the test back works, all is well.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public block explorers are an easy way to independently see whether a transaction has been accepted by the network. However, this convenience has a negative impact on your privacy, because you reveal your addresses to block explorers, which can track you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ether currency units\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum’s currency unit is called ether, identified also as \"ETH\" or with the symbols Ξ (from the Greek letter \"Xi\" that looks like a stylized capital E) or, less often, ♦,** for example, 1 ether, or 1 ETH, or Ξ1, or ♦1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Use Unicode character 926 for Ξ and 9830 for ♦.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ether is subdivided into smaller units, down to the smallest unit possible, which is named **wei**. **One ether is 1 quintillion wei** (1 x $10^{18}$ or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000). You may hear people refer to the currency \"Ethereum\" too, but this is a common beginner’s mistake. **Ethereum is the system, ether is the currency.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The value of ether is always represented internally in Ethereum as an unsigned integer value denominated in wei**. When you transact 1 ether, the transaction encodes 10000000000000000000 wei as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ether’s various denominations have both a scientific name using the International System of units (SI), and a colloquial name that pays homage/respect to many of the great minds of computing and cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following table shows the various units, their colloquial (common) name, and their SI name. In keeping with the internal representation of value, the table shows all denominations in wei (first row), with ether shown as $10^{18}$ wei in the 7th row:\n",

    "## Choosing an Ethereum wallet\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"wallet\" has come to mean many things, although they are all related and on a day-to-day basis they are pretty much the same thing. We will use the term \"wallet\" to mean a software application that helps you manage your Ethereum account. In short, **an Ethereum wallet is your gateway to the Ethereum system. It holds your keys and can create and broadcast transactions on your behalf**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing an Ethereum wallet can be difficult because there are many different options with different features and designs. Some are more suitable for beginners and some are more suitable for experts. Even if you choose one that you like now, you might decide to switch to a different wallet later on. **The Ethereum platform itself is still being improved and the \"best\" wallets are often the ones that adapt to the changes that come with the platform upgrades**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But don’t worry! If you choose a wallet and don’t like how it works, you can change wallets quite easily. **All you have to do is make a transaction that sends your funds from the old wallet to the new wallet, or move the keys by exporting and importing your private keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will choose three different types of wallets to use as examples throughout: a mobile wallet, a desktop wallet, and a web-based wallet. We’ve chosen these three wallets because they represent a broad range of complexity and features. However, the selection of these wallets is not an endorsement of their quality or security. They are simply a good starting place for demonstrations and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that for wallet application to work, it must have access to your private keys, so it is vital that you only download and use wallet applications from sources you can trust. **Fortunately, in general, the more popular a wallet application is, the more trustworthy it is likely to be**. Nevertheless, **it is good practice to avoid \"putting all your eggs in one basket\"** rather have your Ethereum accounts spread across a couple of wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starter wallets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MetaMask**<br>\n",
    "MetaMask is a browser extension wallet that runs in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Brave Browser). It is easy to use and convenient for testing, as it is able to connect to a variety of Ethereum nodes and test blockchains. **MetaMask is a web-based wallet**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jaxx**<br>\n",
    "Jaxx is a multi-platform and multi-currency wallet that runs on a variety of operating systems including Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is often a good choice for new users as it is designed for simplicity and ease of use. **Jaxx is either a mobile or desktop wallet, depending on where you install it.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MyEtherWallet (MEW)**<br>\n",
    "MyEtherWallet is a web-based wallet that runs in any browser. It has multiple sophisticated features we will explore in many of our examples. **MyEtherWallet is a web-based wallet**.<br><br>\n",

    "### Using MetaMask for the first time\n",
    "\n",
    "Once MetaMask is installed you should see a new icon (head of a fox) in your browser’s toolbar. Click on it to get started. You will be asked to accept the terms and conditions and then to create your new Ethereum wallet by entering a password:\n",

    "Extremely Important Note:\n",
    "> **Backup your mnemonic (12 words) on paper, twice. Store the two paper backups in two separate secure locations, such as a fire resistant safe, a locked drawer or a safe deposit box. Treat the paper backups like cash of equivalent value as what you store in your Ethereum wallet. Anyone with access to these words can gain access and steal your money**.\n",

    "### Getting some test ether\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to get our wallet funded. We won’t be doing that on the Main Network because real ether costs money and handling it requires a bit more experience. For now, we will load our wallet with some testnet ether.\n",

    "### Sending ether from MetaMask\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we’ve received our first test ether from the Ropsten Test Faucet, we will experiment with sending ether, by trying to send some back to the faucet. As you can see on the Ropsten Test Faucet page, there is an option to \"donate\" 1 ETH to the faucet. This option is available so that once you’re done testing, you can return the remainder of your test ether, so that someone else can use it next. Even though test ether has no value, some people hoard it, making it difficult for everyone else to use the test networks. Hoarding test ether is frowned upon!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we are not test ether hoarders and we want to practice sending ether anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the orange \"1 ether\" button to tell MetaMask to create a transaction paying the faucet 1 ether. MetaMask will prepare a transaction and pop-up a window with the confirmation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/send_to_faucet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Oops! You probably noticed you can’t complete the transaction. **MetaMask says \"Insufficient balance for transaction\". At first glance this may seem confusing: we have 1 ETH, we want to send 1 ETH, why is MetaMask saying we have insufficient funds?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is because of the cost of gas.<br>**Every Ethereum transaction requires payment of a fee, which is collected by the miners to validate the transaction. The fees in Ethereum are charged in a virtual currency called gas. You pay for the gas with ether, as part of the transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fees are required on the test networks too. Without fees, a test network would behave differently from the main network, making it an inadequate testing platform. **Fees also protect the test networks from denial of service attacks and poorly constructed contracts (e.g. infinite loops), much like they protect the main network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you sent the transaction, **MetaMask calculated the average gas price of recent successful transactions at 3 GWEI**, which stands for 3 gigawei. Wei is the smallest subdivision of the ether currency, as we discussed in Ether currency units. **The gas cost of sending a basic transaction is 21000 gas units. Therefore, the maximum amount of ETH you spend is 3 * 21000 GWEI = 63000 GWEI = 0.000063 ETH**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be advised that average gas prices can fluctuate as they are predominantly determined by miners**. We will see later how you can increase/decrease your gas limit to ensure your transaction takes precedence if need be.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this to say: to make a 1 ETH transaction costs 1.000063 ETH. MetaMask confusingly rounds that down to 1 ETH when showing the total, but the actual amount you need is 1.000063 ETH and you only have 1 ETH. Click \"Reject\" to cancel this transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get some more test ether! Click on the green \"request 1 ether from the faucet\" button again and wait a few seconds. Don’t worry, the faucet should have plenty of ether and will give you more if you ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a balance of 2 ETH, you can try again. This time, when you click on the orange \"1 ether\" donation button, you have sufficient balance to complete the transaction. Click \"Submit\" when MetaMask pops-up the payment window. After all of this, you should see a balance of 0.999937 ETH because you sent 1 ETH to the faucet with 0.000063 ETH in gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring the transaction history of an address\n",
    "By now you have become an expert in using MetaMask to send and receive test ether. Your wallet has received at least two payments and sent at least one. Let’s see all these transactions, using the ropsten.etherscan.io block explorer. You can either copy your wallet address and paste it into the block explorer’s search box, or you can have MetaMask open the page for you.

Before long you will be lost in the maze of interconnected data. Public blockchains contain an enormous wealth of information, all of which can be explored programmatically, as we will see in the future examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing the world computer\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve created a wallet and we’ve sent and received ether. So far, we’ve treated Ethereum as a cryptocurrency. But Ethereum is much, much more. In fact, the cryptocurrency function is subservient to Ethereum’s function as a world computer; a decentralized smart contract platform. **Ether is meant to be used to pay for running smart contracts, which are computer programs that run on an emulated computer called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EVM is a global singleton, meaning that it operates as if it was a global, single-instance computer, running everywhere.**\n",
    "- **Each node on the Ethereum network runs a local copy of the EVM to validate contract execution**, while\n",
    "- **the Ethereum blockchain records the changing state of this world computer as it processes transactions and smart contracts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of account we created in the MetaMask wallet is called an **Externally Owned Account (EOA). Externally owned accounts are those that have a private key; having the private key means control over access to funds or contracts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you’re probably guessing there is another type of account. **The other type of account is a contract account. A contract account has smart contract code, which a simple EOA can’t have. Furthermore, a contract account does not have a private key. Instead, it is owned (and controlled) by the logic of its smart contract code**: <u>the software program recorded on the Ethereum blockchain at the contract account’s creation and executed by the EVM.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Contracts have an address, just like EOAs. Contracts can send and receive ether, just like EOAs. However, **when a transaction destination is a contract address, it causes that contract to run in the EVM, using the transaction, and the transaction’s data, as its input**.\n",
    "> **In addition to ether, transactions can contain data indicating which specific function in the contract to run and what parameters to pass to that function**. In this way, transactions can call functions within contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that because a contract account does not have a private key, it can not initiate a transaction. Only EOAs can initiate transactions, but contracts can react to transactions by calling other contracts, building complex execution paths.** One typical use of this is an EOA sending a request transaction to a multi-signature smart contract wallet to send some ETH on to another address. A typical DApp programming pattern is to have Contract A calling Contract B in order to maintain a shared state across users of Contract A.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections, we will write our first contract. We will then create, fund, and use that contract with our MetaMask wallet and test ether on the Ropsten test network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A simple contract: a test ether faucet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum has many different high-level languages, all of which can be used to write a contract and produce EVM bytecode.** One high-level language is **by far the dominant language for smart contract programming: Solidity. Solidity was created by Gavin Wood, the co-author of this book and has become the most widely used language in Ethereum and beyond**. We’ll use Solidity to write our first contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example, **we will write a contract that controls a faucet**. We’ve already used a faucet to get test ether on the Ropsten test network. <br> **A faucet is a relatively simple thing: it gives out ether to any address that asks and can be refilled periodically**. You can implement a faucet as a wallet controlled by a human (or a web server), but we will write a Solidity contract that implements a faucet:\n",

    "This is a very simple contract, about as simple as we can make it. **It is also a flawed contract, demonstrating a number of bad practices and security vulnerabilities. We will learn by examining all of its flaws in later sections**. But for now, let’s look at what this contract does and how it works, line by line. You will quickly notice that many elements of Solidity are similar to existing programming languages, such as JavaScript, Java or C++\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is a comment:<br>\n",
    "`// Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments are for humans to read and are not included in the executable EVM bytecode.** We usually put them on the line before the code we are trying to explain, or sometimes on the same line. Comments start with two forward slashes //. Everything from the slashes and beyond, until the end of that line, is treated the same as a blank line and ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, the next lines are where our actual contract starts:<br>\n",
    "`contract Faucet {`\n",
    "\n",
    "This line **declares a contract object, similar to a class declaration in other object-oriented languages. The contract definition includes all the lines between the curly braces {} which define a scope**, much like how curly braces are used in many other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we declare the first function of the Faucet contract:<br>\n",
    "`function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {`\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is named withdraw, which takes one **unsigned integer (uint) argument** named withdraw_amount. **It is declared as a public function, meaning it can be called by other contracts**. The function definition follows between curly braces:<br>\n",
    "`require(withdraw_amount <= 100000000000000000);`\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first part of the withdraw function sets a limit on withdrawals. It uses the built-in Solidity function require to test a precondition, that the withdraw_amount is less than or equal to 100000000000000000 wei**, which is the base unit of ether (see Ether Denominations and Unit Names) and equivalent to 0.1 ether. **If the withdraw function is called with a withdraw_amount greater than that amount, the require function here will cause contract execution to stop and fail with an exception. **\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Statements need to be terminated with a semi-colon in Solidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This part of the contract is the main logic of our faucet. It controls the flow of funds out of the contract by placing a limit on withdrawals**. It’s a very simple control but can give you a glimpse of the power of a programmable blockchain: decentralized software controlling money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes the actual withdrawal:<br>\n",
    "`msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);`\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of interesting things are happening here. \n",
    "- The `msg` object is one of the inputs that all contracts can access. It represents the transaction that triggered the execution of this contract. \n",
    "- The attribute `sender` is the sender address of the transaction. \n",
    "- The function `transfer` is a built-in function that transfers ether from the current contract to the address of the sender. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading it backward, this means transfer to the sender of the msg that triggered this contract execution**. The transfer function takes an amount as its only argument. We pass the withdraw_amount value that was the parameter to the withdraw function declared a few lines above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very next line is the closing curly brace, indicating the end of the definition of our withdraw function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we declare one more function:<br>\n",
    "`function () public payable {}`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is a so-called \"**fallback**\" or **default function**, which is **called if the transaction that triggered the contract didn’t name any of the declared functions in the contract, or any function at all, or didn’t contain data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Contracts can have one such default function (without a name) and it is usually the one that receives ether. That’s why it is defined as a public and payable function, which means it can accept ether into the contract. It doesn’t do anything, other than accept the ether, as indicated by the empty definition in the curly brackets {}**. If we make a transaction that sends ether to the contract address, as if it were a wallet, this function will handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right below our default function is the final closing curly bracket, which closes the definition of the contract Faucet. That’s it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling the faucet contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our first example contract, we need to use a Solidity compiler to convert the Solidity code into EVM bytecode, so it can be executed by the EVM on the blockchain itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solidity compiler comes as\n",
    "- a standalone executable \n",
    "- as part of different frameworks, and\n",
    "- bundled in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we will use one of the more popular IDEs, called **Remix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your Chrome browser (with the MetaMask wallet we installed earlier) to navigate to the Remix IDE at:\n",
    "https://remix.ethereum.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you first load Remix, it will start with a sample contract called ballot.sol. We don’t need that, so close it. \n",
    "- Now, add a new tab by clicking on the circular-plus-sign in the left toolbar, naming the new file Faucet.sol:\n",
    "- Once you have a new tab open, copy and paste the code from our example Faucet.sol:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have loaded the Faucet.sol contract into the Remix IDE, the IDE will automatically compile the code. If all goes well, you will see a green box with \"Faucet\" in it appear on the right, under the Compile tab, confirming the successful compilation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_compile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If something goes wrong, the most likely problem is that Remix IDE is using a version of the Solidity compiler that is different from 0.4.19**. In that case, our pragma directive will prevent Faucet.sol from compiling. To change the compiler version, go to the \"Settings\" tab, set the compiler version to 0.4.19, and try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solidity compiler has now compiled our Faucet.sol into EVM bytecode. If you are curious, the bytecode looks like this:<br>\n",

    "### Creating the contract on the blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a contract. We’ve compiled it into bytecode. Now, we need to \"register\" the contract on the Ethereum blockchain. We will be using the Ropsten testnet to test our contract, so that’s the blockchain we want to submit it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Registering a contract on the blockchain involves creating a special transaction, whose destination is the address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, also known as the zero address. The zero address is a special address that tells the Ethereum blockchain that you want to register a contract**. Fortunately, Remix IDE will handle all of that for you and send the transaction to MetaMask.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, switch to the \"Run\" tab and select \"Injected Web3\" in the \"Environment\" drop-down selection box. This connects Remix IDE to the MetaMask wallet, and through MetaMask to the Ropsten Test Network. Once you do that, you can see \"Ropsten\" under Environment. Also, in the Account selection box it shows the address of your wallet:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_run.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Right below the \"Run\" settings we just confirmed, is the Faucet contract, ready to be created. Click on the \"Create\" or \"Deploy\" button:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_create_contract.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remix will construct the **special \"creation\" transaction and MetaMask will ask you to approve it. As you can see from MetaMask, the contract creation transaction has no ether in it, but it has 258 bytes (the compiled contract) and will consume 10 Gwei in gas**. Click \"Submit\" to approve it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_metamask_create.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have to wait. It will take about 15 to 30 seconds for the contract to be mined on Ropsten. Remix won’t appear to be doing much, but be patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the contract is created, it appears at the bottom of the Run tab:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_contract_interact.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the Faucet contract now has an address of its own: Remix shows it as Faucet at 0x72e....c7829. The small clipboard symbol to the right allows you to copy the contract address into your clipboard. We will use that in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interacting with the contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far: \n",
    "- Ethereum contracts are programs that control money, which run inside a virtual machine called the EVM. <br><br>\n",
    "- They are created by a special transaction that submits their bytecode to be recorded on the blockchain. <br><br>\n",
    "- Once they are created on the blockchain, they have an Ethereum address, just like wallets. <br><br>\n",
    "- Anytime someone sends a transaction to a contract address it causes the contract to run in the EVM, with the transaction as its input. <br><br>\n",
    "- Transactions sent to contract addresses may have ether or data or both. If they contain ether, it is \"deposited\" to the contract balance. If they contain data, the data can specify a named function in the contract and call it, passing arguments to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Viewing the contract address in a block explorer\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a contract recorded on the blockchain and we can see it has an Ethereum address. Let’s check it out on the ropsten.etherscan.io block explorer and see what a contract looks like. Copy the address of the contract by clicking on the clipboard icon next to its name:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_contract_address.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep Remix open in a tab, we’ll come back to it again later. Now, navigate your browser to **ropsten.etherscan.io** and paste the address into the search box. You should see the contract’s Ethereum address history:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/etherscan_contract_address.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Funding the contract\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the contract only has one transaction in its history: the contract creation transaction. As you can see, the contract also has no ether (zero balance). That’s because we didn’t send any ether to the contract in the creation transaction, even though we could have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s send some ether to the contract! You should still have the address of the contract in your clipboard (if not, copy it again from Remix). Open MetaMask, and send 1 ether to it, exactly as you would any other Ethereum address:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/metamask_send_to_contract.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a minute, if you reload the etherscan block explorer, it will show another transaction to the contract address and an updated balance of 1 ether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the unnamed default public payable function in our Faucet.sol code? It looked like this:<br>\n",
    "`function () public payable {}`\n",
    "\n",
    ">When you sent a transaction to the contract address, with no data specifying which function to call, it called this default function. Because we declared it as a payable, it accepted and deposited the 1 ether into the contract account balance. Your transaction caused the contract to run in the EVM, updating its balance. We have funded our faucet!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Withdrawing from our contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s withdraw some funds from the faucet. **To withdraw, we have to construct a transaction that calls the withdraw function and passes a withdraw_amount argument to it. To keep things simple for now, Remix will construct that transaction for us and MetaMask will present it for our approval.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Return to the Remix tab and look at the contract under the \"Run\" tab. You should see a red box labeled withdraw with a field entry labeled uint256 withdraw_amount :\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_contract_interact-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the Remix interface to the contract. It allows us to construct transactions that call the functions defined in the contract. We will enter a withdraw_amount and click the withdraw button to generate the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s figure out the withdraw_amount. We want to try and withdraw 0.1 ether, which is the maximum amount allowed by our contract. Remember that all currency values in Ethereum are denominated in wei internally, and our withdraw function expects the withdraw_amount to be denominated in wei too. The amount we want is 0.1 ether, which is 100000000000000000 wei (1 followed by 17 zeros).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Due to a limitation in JavaScript, a number as large as 10^17 cannot be processed by Remix. Instead, we enclose it in double quotes, to allow Remix to receive it as a string and manipulate it as a BigNumber. If we don’t enclose it in quotes, the Remix IDE will fail to process it and display \"Error encoding arguments: Error: Assertion failed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Type \"100000000000000000\" (with the quotes) into the withdraw_amount box and click on the withdraw button:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/remix_withdraw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "MetaMask will pop-up a transaction window for you to approve. Click \"Submit\" to send your withdrawal call to the contract:\n",

    "![](./Images/metamask_withdraw.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "![](./Images/etherscan_withdrawal_tx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now see a new transaction with the contract address as the destination and zero ether. The contract balance has changed and is now 0.9 ether because it sent us 0.1 ether as requested. **But we don’t see an \"OUT\" transaction in the contract address history.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where’s the outgoing withdrawal? A new tab has appeared in the contract’s address history page, named \"Internal Transactions\". Because the 0.1 ether transfer originated from the contract code, it is an internal transaction (also called a message)**. Click on the \"Internal Transactions\" tab to see it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/etherscan_withdrawal_internal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"**internal transaction**\" was sent by the contract in this line of code (from the withdraw function in Faucet.sol):<br>\n",
    "`msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);`\n",
    "\n",
    "Recap: \n",
    "- We sent a transaction from our MetaMask wallet that contained data instructions to call the withdraw function with a withdraw_amount argument of 0.1 ether.<br><br>\n",
    "- That transaction caused the contract to run inside the EVM. As the EVM ran the Faucet contract’s withdraw function, first it called the require function and validated that our amount was less than or equal to the maximum allowed withdrawal of 0.1 ether.<br><br>\n",
    "- Then it called the transfer function to send us the ether. Running the transfer function generated an internal transaction that deposited 0.1 ether into our wallet address, from the contract’s balance. That’s the one shown in the \"Internal Transactions\" tab in etherscan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ve set up a wallet using MetaMask and we’ve funded it using a faucet on the Ropsten Test Network. We received ether into our wallet’s Ethereum address. Then we sent ether to the faucet’s Ethereum address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we wrote a faucet contract in Solidity. We used the Remix IDE to compile the contract into EVM bytecode. We used Remix to form a transaction and created the faucet contract on the Ropsten blockchain. Once created, the faucet contract had an Ethereum address and we sent it some ether. Finally, we constructed a transaction to call the withdraw function and successfully asked for 0.1 ether. The contract checked our request and sent us 0.1 ether with an internal transaction.\n",

    "# Ethereum Clients\n",
    "\n",
    "**An Ethereum client is a software application that implements the Ethereum specification and communicates over the peer-to-peer network with other Ethereum clients. Different Ethereum clients interoperate if they comply with the reference specification and the standardized communications protocols.** While these different clients are implemented by different teams and in different programming languages, they all \"speak\" the same protocol and follow the same rules. As such, they can all be used to operate and interact with the same Ethereum network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum is an open source project and the source code for all the major clients are available under open source licenses (e.g. LGPL v3.0), so they are free to download and use for any purpos**e. Open source means more than simply free to use. It also means that Ethereum is developed by an open community of volunteers and can be modified by anyone. More eyes means more trustworthy code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum is defined by a formal specification called the \"**Yellow Paper**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to, for example, Bitcoin, which is not defined in any formal way. **Where Bitcoin’s \"specification\" is the reference implementation Bitcoin Core, Ethereum’s specification is documented in a paper that combines an English and a mathematical (formal) specification. This formal specification, in addition to various Ethereum Improvement Proposals, defines the standard behavior of an Ethereum client**. The Yellow Paper is periodically updated as major changes are made to Ethereum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a result of Ethereum’s clear formal specification, there are a number of independently developed, yet interoperable, software implementations of an Ethereum client**. Ethereum has a greater diversity of implementations running on the network than any other blockchain, which is generally regarded as a good thing. Indeed, it has, for example, proven itself to be an excellent way of defending against attacks on the network, because exploitation of a particular client’s implementation strategy simply hassles the developers while they patch the exploit, while other clients keep the network running almost unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**There exist a variety of Ethereum-based networks which largely conform to the formal specification defined in the Ethereum \"Yellow Paper,\" but which may or may not interoperate with each other.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these Ethereum-based networks are: **Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ella, Expanse, Ubiq, Musicoin**, and many others.<u> While mostly compatible on a protocol-level, these networks often have features or attributes that require maintainers of Ethereum client software to make small changes in order to support each network. Because of this, not every version of Ethereum client software runs every Ethereum-based blockchain </u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are six main implementations of the Ethereum protocol (Ethereum Clients) written in six different languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parity**, written in Rust<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geth**, written in Go<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cpp-ethereum**, written in C++<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pyethereum**, written in Python<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mantis**, written in Scala,<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Harmony**, written in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will look at the two most common clients, Parity and Geth. We’ll learn to set up a node using each client and explore some of their command-line and application programming interfaces (APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Should I run a full node?\n",
    "\n",
    "The health, resilience, and censorship resistance of blockchains depend on having many independently operated and geographically dispersed full nodes. **Each full node can help other new nodes obtain the block data to bootstrap their operation, as well as offer the operator an authoritative and independent verification of all transactions and contracts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, running a full node will incur a cost in hardware resources and bandwidth**. A full node must download more than 80GB of data (as of April 2018; depending on client) and store it on a local hard drive. This data burden increases quite rapidly every day as new transactions and blocks are added. More on this topic in Hardware Requirements for a Full Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A full node running on a live mainnet network is not necessary for Ethereum development. You can do almost everything you need to do**:\n",
    "- with a testnet node (which connects you to one of the smaller public test blockchains), \n",
    "- with a local private blockchain, or \n",
    "- with a cloud-based Ethereum client offered by a service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You also have the option of running a \"remote client\" which does not store a local copy of the blockchain or validate blocks and transactions. These clients offer the functionality of a wallet and can create and broadcast transactions**. Remote clients can be used to connect to existing networks, such as your own full node, a public blockchain, a public or permissioned (PoA) testnet, or a private local blockchain. In practice, you will likely use a remote client such as **MetaMask, Emerald Wallet, MyEtherWallet** or **MyCrypto** as a convenient way to switch between all of the different node options.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The terms \"**remote client**\" and \"**wallet**\" are used interchangeably, though there are some differences. Usually, a remote client offers an API (such as the web3js API) in addition to the transaction functionality of a wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not confuse the concept of a remote wallet in Ethereum with that of a light client (which is analogous to a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) client in Bitcoin). <br>\n",
    "**Light clients (SPV) validate block headers and use Merkle proofs to validate the inclusion of transactions in the blockchain and determine their effects, rendering them of a similar level of security to a full node. Conversely, Ethereum remote clients do not validate block headers or transactions. They entirely trust a full client operated by a third party (which could be you) to give them RPC access to the blockchain and as such lose significant security and anonymity guarantees.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Node Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing to run a full node helps with the operation of the networks you connect it to, but also incurs some mild to moderate costs for you. Let’s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports the resilience and censorship resistance of Ethereum-based networks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authoritatively validates all transactions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can interact with any contract on the public blockchain (without requiring an intermediary).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can query (read-only) the blockchain status (accounts, contracts, etc.) offline, if necessary.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can query the blockchain without letting a third party know the information you’re reading.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can directly deploy your own contracts into the public blockchain (without requiring an intermediary).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires significant and growing hardware and bandwidth resources.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires several hours or days to fully sync for the first initial download.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Must be maintained, upgraded and kept online to remain synced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Testnet Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Whether or not you choose to run a full node, you will probably want to run a public testnet node.** Let’s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a public testnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A testnet node needs to sync and store much less data, ~10GB depending on the network (as of April 2018).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A testnet node can sync fully in a few hours.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploying contracts or making transactions requires test ether, which has no value and can be acquired for free from several \"faucets\".<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testnets are public blockchains with many other users and contracts, running \"live.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can’t use \"real\" money on a testnet, it runs on test ether.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consequently, you can’t test security against real adversaries, as there is nothing at stake.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are some aspects of a public blockchain that you cannot test realistically on testnet. For example, transaction fees, although necessary to send transactions, are not a consideration on testnet since gas is free. And the testnets do not experience network congestion like the public mainnet sometimes does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Instance (ganache) Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "For many testing purposes, the best option is to launch a single instance private blockchain, using the ganache local test blockchain. **Ganache (formerly named testrpc) creates a local-only, private blockchain that you can interact with, without any other participants**. It shares many of the advantages and disadvantages of the public testnet, but also has some differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- No syncing and almost no data on disk. You mine the first block yourself.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- No need to find test ether, you \"award\" yourself mining rewards that you can use for testing.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- No other users, just you.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- No other contracts, just the ones you deploy after you launch it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having no other users means that it doesn’t behave the same as a public blockchain. There’s no competition for transaction space or sequencing of transactions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- No miners other than you means that mining is more predictable, therefore you can’t test some scenarios that occur on a public blockchain.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having no other contracts means you have to deploy everything that you want to test, including dependencies and contract libraries.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can’t recreate some of the public contracts and their addresses to test some scenarios (e.g. the DAO contract).\n",

    "## Running an Ethereum client\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",
    "> Instead of compiling the source code of the Ethereum client, which would require installation of multiple support libraries (as can be seen in the demonstration below), **simply go to the corresponding official website of that client and grab the executables/pre-compiled binaries**.<br>\n",
    "Ex: Geth executables can be installed from https://geth.ethereum.org/ instead of going to Geth's github repo, cloning and building executables from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the time and resources, you should attempt to run a full node, even if only to learn more about the process. **In the next few sections we will download, compile, and run the Ethereum clients Parity and Geth. This requires some familiarity with using the command-line interface on your operating system. It’s worth installing these clients whether you choose to run them as full nodes, as testnet nodes, or as clients to a local private blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Requirements for a Full Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, you should ensure you have a computer with sufficient resources to run an Ethereum full node. You will need at least 80GB of disk space to store a full copy of the Ethereum blockchain. If you also want to run a full node on the Ethereum testnet, you will need at least an additional 15GB. Downloading 80GB of blockchain data can take a long time, so it’s recommended that you work on a fast Internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syncing the Ethereum blockchain is very input-output (I/O) intensive. It is best to have a Solid-State Drive (SSD). If you have a mechanical hard disk drive (HDD), you will need at least 8GB of RAM to use as cache. Otherwise, you may discover that your system is too slow to keep up and sync fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- CPU with 2+ cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At least 80GB free storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4GB RAM minimum with a SSD, 8GB+ if you have an HDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 8 MBit/sec download Internet service.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the minimum requirements to sync a full (but pruned) copy of an Ethereum-based blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing (April 2018) the Parity codebase is lighter on resources, so if you’re running with limited hardware you’ll likely see the better results using Parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to sync in a reasonable amount of time and store all the development tools, libraries, clients, and blockchains we discuss in this book, you will want a more capable computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Specifications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast CPU with 4+ cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 16GB+ RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast SSD with at least 500GB free space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s difficult to predict how fast a blockchain’s size will increase and when more disk space will be required, so it’s recommended to check the blockchain’s latest size before you start syncing.\n",

    "### Software Requirements for Building and Running a Client (Node)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers Parity and Geth client software. It also assumes you are using a Unix-like command-line environment. The examples show the output and commands as entered on an Ubuntu Linux operating system running the Bash shell (command-line execution environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typically every blockchain will have their own version of Geth, while Parity provides support for multiple Ethereum-based blockchains (Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ellaism, Expanse, Musicoin) with the same client download.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we may need to get some prerequisites satisfied. If you’ve never done any software development on the computer you are currently using, you will probably need to install some basic tools. For the examples that follow, you will need to install:\n",
    "- **git**, the source-code management system; \n",
    "- **golang**, the Go programming language and standard libraries; and \n",
    "- **Rust**, a systems programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git can be installed by following the instructions here: https://git-scm.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Go can be installed by following the instructions here: https://golang.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Geth requirements vary, but if you stick with Go version 1.10 or greater you should be able to compile any version of Geth you want. Of course, you should always refer to the documentation for your chosen flavor of Geth.<br><br>\n",
    "The version of golang that is installed on your operating system or is available from your system’s package manager may be significantly older than 1.10. If so, remove it and install the latest version from golang.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust can be installed by following the instructions here: https://www.rustup.rs/\n",
    "\n",
    "> Parity requires Rust version 1.24 or greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parity also requires some software libraries, such as OpenSSL and libudev. To install these on a Linux (Debian) compatible system:<br>\n",
    "`sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev libudev-dev`\n",
    "\n",
    "For other operating systems, use the package manager of your OS or follow the Wiki instructions (https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Setup) to install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have git, golang, rust, and necessary libraries installed, let’s get to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parity is an implementation of a full node Ethereum client and DApp browser. Parity was written from the \"ground up\" in Rust, a systems programming language with the aim of building a modular, secure, and scalable Ethereum client**. Parity is developed by Parity Tech, a UK company, and is released under a GPLv3 open source license.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Disclosure: One of the authors of this book, Gavin Wood, is the founder of Parity Tech and wrote much of the Parity client. Parity represents about 28% of the installed Ethereum client base.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Parity, you can use the Rust package manager cargo or download the source code from GitHub. The package manager also downloads the source code, so there’s not much difference between the two options. In the next section, we will show you how to download and compile Parity yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing Parity**<br>\n",
    "The Parity Wiki offers instructions for building Parity in different environments and containers:\n",
    "https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll build Parity from source. This assumes you have already installed Rust using rustup.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s get the source code from GitHub:<br>\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/paritytech/parity`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s change to the parity directory and use cargo to build the executable:<br>\n",
    "`cd parity` <br>\n",
    "`cargo build`\n",
    "\n",
    "If all goes well, you should see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BuildingParity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now that Parity is installed, we can sync the blockchain and get started with some basic command-line options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go-Ethereum (Geth)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geth is the Go language implementation, which is actively developed by the Ethereum Foundation, so is considered the \"official\" implementation of the Ethereum client. Typically, every Ethereum-based blockchain will have its own Geth implementation**. If you’re running Geth, then you’ll want to make sure you grab the correct version for your blockchain using one of the repository links below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repository Links:\n",
    "- Ethereum: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum (or https://geth.ethereum.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ethereum Classic: https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ellaism: https://github.com/ellaism/go-ellaism\n",

    "\n",
    "- Ubiq: https://github.com/ubiq/go-ubiq\n",
    "\n",
    "> **You can also skip these instructions and install a precompiled binary for your platform of choice. The precompiled releases are much easier to install and can be found at the \"release\" section of the repositories above**. However, you may learn more by downloading and compiling the software yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloning the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to clone the git repository, so as to get a copy of the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a local clone of this repository, use the git command as follows, in your home directory or under any directory you use for development:<br>\n",
    "`git clone <Repository Link>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now that we have a local copy of Geth, we can compile an executable for our platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building Geth from Source Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To build Geth, change to the directory where the source code was downloaded and use the make command:<br>\n",
    "` cd go-ethereum`<br>\n",
    "`make geth`\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Buildin-Geth.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your geth version command may show slightly different information, but you should see a version report much like the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we may want to copy the geth command to our operating system’s application directory (or a directory on the command-line execution path). On Linux, we’d use the following command:<br>\n",
    "`sudo cp ./build/bin/geth /usr/local/bin`\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t start running geth yet, because it will start synchronizing the blockchain \"the slow way,\" and that will take far too long (weeks). The First Synchronization of Ethereum-based Blockchains explains the challenge with the initial synchronization of Ethereum’s blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The First Synchronization of Ethereum-based Blockchains\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normally, when syncing an Ethereum blockchain, your client will download and validate every block and every transaction since the very start, i.e. from the genesis block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to fully sync the blockchain this way, the sync will take a very long time and has high computing resource requirements (much more RAM and faster storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many Ethereum-based blockchains were the victim of a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack at the end of 2016. Blockchains affected by this attack will tend to sync slowly when doing a full sync.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, **on Ethereum, a new client will make rapid progress until it reaches block 2,283,397. This block was mined on 2016/09/18 and marks the beginning of the DoS attacks. From this block and until block 2,700,031 (2016/11/26), the validation of transactions becomes extremely slow, memory intensive, and I/O intensive**. This results in validation times exceeding 1 minute per block. Ethereum implemented a series of upgrades, using hard forks, to address the underlying vulnerabilities that were exploited in the denial of service attacks. These upgrades also cleaned up the blockchain by removing some 20 million empty accounts created by spam transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are syncing with full validation, your client will slow down and may take several days, or perhaps even longer, to validate the blocks affected by this DoS attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fortunately, most Ethereum clients include an option to perform a \"fast\" synchronization that skips the full validation of transactions until it has synced to the tip of the blockchain, then resumes full validation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For Geth, the option to enable fast synchronization is typically called --fast. You may need to refer to the specific instructions for your chosen Ethereum chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Parity, the option is --warp for older versions (< 1.6) and is enabled by default (no need to set a configuration option) on newer versions (>= 1.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Geth can only operate fast synchronization when starting with an empty block database. If you have already started syncing without \"fast\" mode, Geth cannot switch. It is faster to delete the blockchain data directory and start \"fast\" syncing from the beginning than to continue syncing with full validation. Be careful to not delete any wallets when deleting the blockchain data!\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON-RPC Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethereum clients offer an Application Programming Interface (API) and a set of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) commands, which are encoded as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You will see this referred to as the JSON-RPC API. Essentially, the JSON-RPC API is an interface that allows us to write programs that use an Ethereum client as a gateway into an Ethereum network and blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Usually, the RPC interface is offered over as an HTTP service on port 8545. For security reasons it is restricted, by default, to only accept connections from localhost (the IP address of your own computer which is 127.0.0.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the JSON-RPC API:\n",
    "- you can **use a specialized library**, written in the programming language of your choice, which provides \"stub\" function calls corresponding to each available RPC command. \n",
    "- Or, you can **manually construct HTTP requests and send/receive JSON encoded requests**. You can even use a generic command-line HTTP client, like curl, to call the RCP interface. Let’s try that. First, ensure that you have Geth configured and running, then switch to a new terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using curl to call the web3_clientVersion function over JSON-RPC\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Curl-JsonRPC.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use curl to make an HTTP connection to address http://localhost:8545. We are already running geth, which offers the JSON-RPC API as an HTTP service on port 8545. We instruct curl to use the HTTP POST command and to identify the content as Content-Type: application/json. Finally, we pass a JSON-encoded request as the data component of our HTTP request. Most of our command line is just setting up curl to make the HTTP connection correctly. The interesting part is the actual JSON-RPC command we issue:<br>\n",
    "`{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"web3_clientVersion\",\"params\":[],\"id\":4192}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**The JSON-RPC request is formatted according to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, which you can see here:** http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Each request contains 4 elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **jsonrpc**<br>\n",
    "Version of the JSON-RPC protocol. This MUST be exactly \"2.0\".<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **method**<br>\n",
    "The name of the method to be invoked.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **params**<br>\n",
    "A structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method. This member MAY be omitted.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id**<br>\n",
    "An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included. The Server MUST reply with the same value in the Response object if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The id parameter is used primarily when you are making multiple requests in a single JSON-RPC call, a practice called batching. Batching is used to avoid the overhead of a new HTTP and TCP connection for every request**. In the Ethereum context for example, we would use batching if we wanted to retrieve thousands of transactions in one HTTP connection. When batching, you set a different id for each request and then match it to the id in each response from the JSON-RPC server. The easiest way to implement this is to maintain a counter and increment the value for each request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response we receive is:<br>\n",
    "`{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":4192,\"result\":\"Geth/v1.8.0-unstable-02aeb3d7/linux-amd64/go1.8.3\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that the JSON-RPC API is being served by Geth client version 1.8.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try something a bit more interesting. In the next example, we ask the JSON-RPC API for the current price of gas in wei:\n",
    "![](./Images/RPC-GasPrice.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The full JSON-RPC API can be investigated on the Ethereum wiki: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parity’s Geth Compatibility Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Parity has a special \"Geth Compatibility Mode\", where it offers a JSON-RPC API that is identical to that offered by geth. To run Parity in Geth Compatibility Mode, use the --geth switch: `parity --geth`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote Ethereum Clients\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote clients offer a subset of the functionality of a full client. **They do not store the full Ethereum blockchain, so they are faster to setup and require far less data storage.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **remote client offers one or more of the following functions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manage private keys and Ethereum addresses in a wallet.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create, sign, and broadcast transactions.<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "- Inject a web3 instance into the web browser as a JavaScript object.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a web3 instance provided/injected into the browser by another client.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access RPC services on a local or remote Ethereum node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some remote clients, for example mobile (smartphone) wallets, offer only basic wallet functionality. Other remote clients are fully-developed DApp browsers**. Remote clients commonly offer some of the functions of a full node Ethereum client without synchronizing a local copy of the Ethereum blockchain by connecting to a full node being run elsewhere, e.g. by you locally on your machine or on a web server, or by a third party on their servers.\n",
    "\n",

    "**You can either connect to publicly available test networks or spawn a private test network of your own**. First, let’s use a public testnet for easier setup. To use a public testnet requires some testnet ether and a connection to that network. **For testnet ether, \"faucets\" are used, which distribute test ether slowly, \"dripping\" out a small amount to anyone who asks. To connect to a testnet, you need an Ethereum client, either a full client such as geth, or a gateway to a full client, such as MetaMask.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Test Ether\n",
    "\n",
    "Since testnets do not operate with real money, **the incentive to secure the testnets by miners is low. Therefore, the testnets must protect themselves from abuse and attacks differently**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**As a result, faucets were created for these testnets to distribute free test ether to developers in a controlled manner (most faucets 'drip' ether at 1 ether every few seconds or so)**. This controlled distribution of ether prevents users from abusing the chain since giving a limited supply of ether prevents them from writing too much to the chain or executing too many transactions. <u>Additionally, some testnets have implemented **Proof of Authentication schemes**, where using a faucet requires authentication from a social media site with proper credentials</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to Testnets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metamask\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metamask fully supports the Ropsten, Kovan and Rinkeby testnets, but connecting to other testnets and local networks is also possible**. In Metamask, simply clicking the drop down that says 'Main Network' allows you to switch networks. MetaMask also offers an option to \"buy\" test ether, which directs you to a faucet where you can request free test ether. **If the Ropsten testnet is used, ether can be obtained from the Ropsten Test Faucet Service**. You can access this faucet from this page. It requires the Metamask extension to work. https://faucet.metamask.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infura\n",
    "\n",
    "**When MetaMask connects to a test network, it uses the Infura service provider for the JSON-RPC interface**. Infura was born with the goal of delivering stable and reliable RPC access to the internal projects within ConsenSys. <br>\n",
    "**In addition to a JSON-RPC API, Infura also offers**:\n",
    "- a REST (Representational State Transfer) API, \n",
    "- IPFS (Interplanetary File System, ie. decentralized storage) API, and \n",
    "- a Websockets (ie. streaming) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infura offers gateway APIs to the Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby, and INFURAnet (a custom testnet for Infura).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Infura via MetaMask for low levels of activity, you do not need an account. **For direct use of the API, you need to register an account and use an API key provided by Infura.**\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on Infura can be found at: https://infura.io/\n",

    "### Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remix IDE may be used to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the mainnet and testnets including Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Kovan** (Web3 Provider using an Infura address and an API key or via Injected Web3 to use the network chosen in MetaMask) **and Ganache** (Web3 Provider Endpoint http://localhost:8545)\n",

    "### Geth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geth natively supports both the Ropsten and Rinkeby networks**. To connect to the Ropsten network use the command-line argument:<br>\n",
    "`geth --testnet`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start syncing the Ropsten blockchain. A new directory named testnet will be created in your main Ethereum data directory. A keystore directory will be created inside testnet and will store the private keys of your testnet accounts. As of writing this, the Ropsten blockchain is significantly smaller than the main Ethereum blockchain: about 14GB of data. Since the testnet requires fewer resources, it is simpler to setup and test your code on the testnet first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interacting with the testnet is similar to the mainnet**. You can start Geth testnet with a console, by running:<br>\n",
    "`geth --testnet console`\n",
    "\n",
    "**This makes it possible to perform operations such as opening a new account, checking your balance, checking the balance of other Ethereum addresses, et**c. When running outside of the Geth console, operations can be performed similarly to how they would have been performed on the mainnet, simply by adding the --testnet parameter to the command-line instruction. As an example to list all the available testnet accounts and their addresses, run:<br>\n",
    "`geth --testnet account list`\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Although much smaller, it will still take some time for the testnet to fully sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if geth has completed syncing the testnet by running the following command in the geth interactive console:<br>\n",
    "`eth.getBlock(\"latest\").number`\n",
    "\n",
    "This should return a number other than 0 once your testnet node is fully in sync. You can compare the number to the latest block in a known testnet block explorer, such as https://ropsten.etherscan.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to connect to the Rinkeby test network, use the command-line argument:<br>\n",
    "`geth --rinkeby`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Parity client supports the Ropsten and Kovan test networks**. You can select the network you want to connect to with the chain argument. For example, to sync the Ropsten test network:<br>\n",
    "`parity --chain ropsten`\n",

    "Olympic testnet (Network ID: 0) was the first public testnet for Frontier (referred to as Ethereum 0.9). It was launched in early 2015 and deprecated in mid 2015 when it was replaced by Morden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum’s Morden testnet (Network ID: 2) was launched with Frontier and ran from July 2015 until it was deprecated in November 2016. While anyone using Ethereum can create a testnet, Morden was the first \"official\" public testnet and replaced the Olympic testnet. Due to long sync times stemming from a bloated blockchain, and consensus issues between the Geth and Parity clients, the testnet was rebooted and reborn as Ropsten.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ropsten (Network ID: 3) is a public cross-client testnet for Homestead that was introduced in late 2016 and ran smoothly as the public testnet until the end of February 2017. According to Péter Szilágyi, a core developer for Ethereum, the end of February is when \"malicious actors decided to abuse the low PoW and gradually inflated the block gas limits to 9 billion (from the normal 4.7 million), at which point sending in gigantic transactions crippled the entire network\". Ropsten was recovered in March 2017. https://github.com/ethereum/ropsten\n",
    "\n",
    "Kovan (Network ID: 42) named after a metro station in Singapore is a public Parity testnet for Homestead that is powered by Parity’s Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm. The testnet is immune to spam attacks because the Ether supply is controlled by trusted parties. Those trusted parties are companies that are actively developing on Ethereum. While it seems like this should be a solution to Ethereum’s testnet troubles, there appear to be consensus issues within the Ethereum community regarding the Kovan testnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rinkeby (Network ID: 4) named after a metro station in Stockholm is a public Geth testnet for Homestead that was started in April 2017 by the Ethereum team and uses the PoA consensus protocol.

    "One of Ethereum’s foundational technologies is cryptography, which is a branch of mathematics used extensively in computer security. Cryptography means \"secret writing\" in Greek, but the study of cryptography encompasses more than just secret writing, which is referred to as encryption. **Cryptography can, for example, also be used to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing that secret (e.g. with a digital signature), or to prove the authenticity of data (e.g. with digital fingerprints, also known as \"hashes\"). These types of cryptographic proofs are mathematical tools critical to the operation of the Ethereum platform (and, indeed, arguable all blockchain systems), and are also extensively used in Ethereum applications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, at the time of publication, no part of the Ethereum protocol involves encryption; that is to say all communication with the Ethereum platform and between nodes (including transaction data) are unencrypted and can (necessarily) be read by anyone. This is so everyone can verify the correctness of state updates and consensus can be reached. **In the future, advanced cryptographic tools, such as \"zero knowledge proofs\" and \"homomorphic encryption\" will be available that will allow for some encrypted calculations to be recorded on the blockchain while still having consensus possible, but (while prevision has been made for them) they have yet to be deployed**. In this chapter we will introduce some of the cryptography used in Ethereum, namely \"public key cryptography\", which is used to control ownership of funds, in the form of private keys and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, **Ethereum has two different types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contracts. In this section we will examine the use of cryptography to establish ownership of ether by externally owned accounts, i.e. private keys.** Private keys enable many of the interesting properties of Ethereum, including decentralized trust and control, and ownership attestation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ownership of ether in EOAs is established through digital private keys, Ethereum addresses, and digital signatures. **The private keys are at the heart of all user interaction with Ethereum. In fact, account addresses and digital signatures are derived directly from private keys: a private key uniquely determines the single Ethereum address (which we also refer to as 'an account') which is used on-chain to identify access to funds and smart contract operations.** That access is gained using digital signatures, which are also created using the private key. \n",
    "\n",
    "**While the Ethereum specification dictates the exact form a private key must take, private keys are not used directly in the platform’s protocol in any way. That is to say that private keys should remain private and never appear in messages passed to the network nor should they be stored on-chain; it is the derived addresses and signatures that are used in the protocol**. Ethereum wallet apps often use several private keys behind-the-scenes, which arguably adds to security. They can do this easily, partly because **the generation of private keys doesn’t need any connection to, or even knowledge of, the Ethereum blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum transactions require a valid digital signature to be included in the blockchain, which, as we’ve touched on, can only be generated with a private key; therefore, anyone with a copy of that private key has control of that account and any Ether it holds. **Assuming a user keeps their private key safe, the derived digital signatures in Ethereum transactions prove the true owner of the funds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> In PKC (Public Key Cryptography) systems, such as that used by Ethereum, keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key. Think of the public key as similar to a bank account number and the private key as similar to the secret PIN; it is the later that provides control over the account, and the former that identifies it for others. **The private keys themselves are very rarely seen by the users of Ethereum; for the most part, they are stored (in encrypted form) in special files and managed by Ethereum wallet software.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the payment portion of an Ethereum transaction, the intended recipient is represented by an Ethereum address, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary account details of a bank transfer. As we will look into in more detail below, an Ethereum address for an EOA is generated from the public key portion of a PC key pair. **However, not all Ethereum addresses represent public-private key pairs; they can also represent contracts, which, as we will see later, are not backed by private keys.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this section, we will first explore basic cryptography in a bit more detail and explain the mathematics used in Ethereum. Next, we will look at how keys are generated, stored, and managed. Finally, we will review the various encoding formats used to represent private keys, public keys, and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public key cryptography and cryptocurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key cryptography (also called \"asymmetric cryptography\") is a core concept of modern day information security. First publicly invented in the 1970s by Martin Hellman, Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle, it was a monumental breakthrough which incited the first big wave of public interest into the field of cryptography. Before the 70s, strong cryptographic knowledge was held under governmental control with little public research until the open publication of public key cryptography research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key cryptography uses unique keys that are used to secure information. **These unique keys are based on mathematical functions that have a very special property: they are easy to calculate in one direction, but very difficult to calculate in the inverse direction.<br> Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures which are secured by the laws of mathematics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, multiplying two large prime numbers together is trivial. But given the product of two large primes, it is very difficult to find the prime factors (a problem called prime factorization). Let’s say I present the number 8018009 and tell you it is the product of two primes. Finding those two primes is much harder than it was for me to multiply them to produce 8018009.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some of these mathematical functions can be inverted easily if you know some secret information**.\n",
    "In our example above, if I tell you that one of the prime factors is 2003, you can trivially find the other one with a simple division: 8018009 / 2003 = 4003. Such \"one way\" functions are called trapdoor functions because they are very difficult to invert, unless you are given a piece of secret information that can be used as a shortcut to reverse the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more advanced category of mathematical functions that is useful in cryptography is based on arithmetic operations on an elliptic curve.\n",
    "> **In elliptic curve arithmetic, multiplication modulo a prime is simple but division (the inverse) is practically impossible. This is called the discrete logarithm problem and there are currently no known trapdoors. Elliptic curve cryptography is used extensively in modern computer systems and is the basis of Ethereum’s (and other cryptocurrencies') use of private keys and digital signatures.**\n",

    "In Ethereum, we use public key cryptography (also known as asymmetric cryptography) to create the public-private key pair we have been talking about in this chapter. **They are considered a \"pair\" because the public key is derived from the private key. Together, they represent an Ethereum account by providing, respectively, a publicly accessible account handle (the address) and private control over access of any ether in the account and over any authentication the account needs when using smart contracts**. The private key controls access by being the unique piece of information needed to create digital signatures, which are needed to sign transactions to spend any funds in the account. Digital signatures are also used to authenticate owners or users of contracts, as we will see in contract authentication section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital signature can be created to sign any message. \n",
    "> **For Ethereum transactions, it is the details of the transaction itself that is used as \"the message\"**. The mathematics of cryptography, and in this case, elliptic curve cryptography, provides a way for the message (i.e. the transaction details) to be combined with the private key to create a code that can only be produced with knowledge of the private key. That code is called the **digital signature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an Ethereum transaction is basically a request to access a particular account with a particular Ethereum address. **When a transaction is sent to the Ethereum network in order to move funds or interact with smart contracts, it needs to be sent with a digital signature created with the private key corresponding to the Ethereum address in question.**\n",
    "> Elliptic curve mathematics means that anyone can verify that a transaction is valid, by checking that the digital signature matches the transaction details and the Ethereum address to which access is being requested. The verification doesn’t involve the private key at all - that remains private. \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, the verification process determines beyond doubt that the transaction could have only come from someone with the private key that corresponds to the public key behind the Ethereum address**. This is the \"magic\" of public key cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In most wallet implementations, the private and public keys are stored together as a key pair for convenience. However, the public key can be trivially calculated from the private key, so storing only the private key is also possible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **no encryption** as part of the Ethereum protocol, i.e. **all messages that are sent as part of the operation of the Ethereum network can (necessarily) be read by everyone.** As such, private keys are only used to create digital signatures for transaction authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private keys\n",
    "\n",
    "A private key is simply a number, picked at random. **Ownership and control over the private key is the root of user control over all funds associated with the corresponding Ethereum address, as well as access to contracts that authorize that address.** The private key is used to create signatures that are required to spend ether by proving ownership of funds used in a transaction. The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the ether and contracts secured by that private key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss. If it’s lost, it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are lost forever too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ethereum private key is just a number. One way to pick your private keys randomly is to simply use a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256 times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you can use in an Ethereum wallet (probably - see below). The public key and address can then be generated from the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating a private key from a random number\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness. Creating an Ethereum private key is essentially the same as \"pick a number between 1 and $2^{256}$\". The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or **deterministic. Ethereum software uses the underlying operating system’s random number generator to produce 256 random bits. Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds, or press random keys on your keyboard.** An alternative could be cosmic radiation noise on the computer’s microphone channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, private keys can be any non-zero number up to a very large number slightly less than $2^{256}$ - a huge 78-digit number, roughly 1.158 * $10^{77}$. The exact number shares the first 38 digits with $2^{256}$ and is defined as the order of the elliptic curve used in Ethereum. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To create a private key:**\n",
    "- we randomly pick a 256-bit number and check that it is within the valid range.<br><br>\n",
    "- In programming terms, this is usually achieved by feeding an even larger string of random bits (collected from a cryptographically secure source of randomness) into a 256-bit hash algorithm such as Keccak-256 or SHA256, both of which will conveniently produce a 256-bit number.<br><br>\n",
    "- If the result within the valid range, we have a suitable private key. Otherwise, we simply try again with another random number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the private key generation process is an off-line one; it does not require any communication with the Ethereum network, or indeed any communication with anyone at all.** As such, in order to pick a number that no-one else will ever pick, it needs to be truly random. If you choose the number yourself, the chance someone else will try it (and then run off with your ether) is too high. **Using a bad random number generator (like the pseudo-random rand() function is most programming languages) is even worse, because it is even more obvious and even easier to replicate**. Just like with passwords for online accounts, it needs to be unguessable. Fortunately, you never need to remember your private key, so you can take the best possible approach for picking your private key, namely true randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The size of Ethereum’s private key space, (roughly $2^{256}$) is an unfathomably large number.

    "Elliptic curve addition is defined such that given two points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 + P2, also on the elliptic curve.\n",

    "\n",
    "**If P1 and P2 are the same point, the line \"between\" P1 and P2 should extend to be the tangent on the curve at this point P1. This tangent will intersect the curve in exactly one new point. You can use techniques from calculus to determine the slope of the tangent line**. Curiously, these techniques work, even though we are restricting our interest to points on the curve with two integer coordinates!\n",
    "\n",
    "In elliptic curve math, there is also a point called the \"**point at infinity**\", which roughly corresponds to the role of the number zero in addition. On computers, it’s sometimes represented by x = y = 0 (which doesn’t satisfy the elliptic curve equation, but it’s an easy separate case that can be checked). There are a couple of special cases that explain the need for the \"point at infinity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**In some cases (e.g. if P1 and P2 have the same x values but different y values), the line will be exactly vertical, in which case P3 = \"point at infinity\".**\n",

    "**If P1 is the \"point at infinity,\" then P1 + P2 = P2. Similarly, if P2 is the point at infinity, then P1 + P2 = P1**. This shows how the point at infinity plays the role that zero plays in \"normal\" arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that + is associative, which means that (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). That means we can write A + B + C (without parentheses) without ambiguity.\n",

    "Now that we have defined addition, **we can define multiplication in the standard way that extends addition. For a point P on the elliptic curve, if k is a whole number, then k * P = P + P + P + …​ + P (k times)**. Note that k is sometimes (perhaps confusingly) called an \"exponent\" in this case.\n",

Even if you find some input data that creates a matching hash, it may not be the original input data: hash functions are \"many to one\" functions. **Finding two sets of input data that hash to the same output is called finding a \"hash collision\".

    "\n",
    "EIP-55 offers a backward compatible checksum for Ethereum addresses by modifying the capitalization of the hexadecimal address. **The idea is that Ethereum addresses are case-insensitive and all wallets are supposed to accept Ethereum addresses expressed in capital or lower-case characters, without any difference in interpretation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**By modifying the capitalization of the alphabetic characters in the address, we can convey a checksum that can be used to protect the integrity of the address against typing or reading mistakes**. \n",

    "- But those that do support it, **can validate it and detect errors with a 99.986% accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixed-capitals encoding is subtle and you may not notice it at first. Our example address is:<br>\n",

    "- Our address contains an alphabetic character d in the fourth position. The fourth character of the hash is 6, which is less than 8. So, we leave the d lower-case. The next alphabetic character in our address is f, in the sixth position. The sixth character of the hexadecimal hash is c, which is greater than 8. Therefore, we capitalize the F in the address, and so on. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you can see, **we only use the first 20-bytes (40 hex characters) of the hash as a checksum, since we only have 20-bytes (40 hex characters) in the address to capitalize appropriately.**<br><br>\n",

    "# Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"wallet\" is used to describe a few different things in Ethereum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At a high level, a wallet is a software application that serves as the primary user interface to Ethereum**. The wallet controls access to a user’s money, managing keys and addresses, tracking the balance, and creating and signing transactions. In addition, some Ethereum wallets can also interact with contracts, such as ERC20 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "More narrowly, from a programmer’s perspective, the word \"wallet\" refers to the system used to store and manage a user’s keys. **Every \"wallet\" has a key management component. For some wallets, that’s all there is. Other wallets are part of a much broader category, that of \"browsers\", which are interfaces to Ethereum-based decentralized applications or \"DApps\"**. There are no clear lines of distinction between the various categories that are conflated under the term \"wallet\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will look at wallets as containers for private keys, and as systems for managing these keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wallet Technology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we summarize the various technologies used to construct user-friendly, secure, and flexible Ethereum wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A common misconception about Ethereum is that Ethereum wallets contain ether or tokens. In fact, very strictly speaking, the wallet holds only keys**. The ether or other tokens are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. **Users control the tokens on the network by signing transactions with the keys in their wallets**. In a sense, an Ethereum wallet is a **keychain**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, given that the keys held by the wallet are exclusively the things that are needed to transfer ether or tokens to others, in practice this distinction is fairly irrelevant. **Where the difference does matter is in changing one’s mindset** \n",
    "\n",
    "- From: **dealing with the centralized system of conventional banking** (where only you, and the bank, can see the money in your account, and you only need convince the bank that you want to move funds to make a transaction) <br><br>\n",
    "- To: **decentralized system of blockchain platforms** (where everyone can see the ether balance of an account, although they probably don’t know the account’s owner, and everyone needs to be convinced the owner wants to move funds for a transaction to be enacted).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice this means that there is an independent way to check an account’s balance, without needing its wallet**. Moreover, you can move your account handling from your current wallet to a different wallet, if you grow to dislike the wallet app you started out using.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ethereum wallets contain keys, not ether or tokens. Wallets are like keychains containing pairs of private/public keys. Users sign transactions with the private keys, thereby proving they own the ether. **The ether is stored on the blockchain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are two primary types of wallets, distinguished by whether the keys they contain are related to each other or not**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first type is a **nondeterministic wallet**, where each key is independently generated from a different random number. The keys are not related to each other. This type of wallet is also known as a **JBOK wallet** from the phrase \"Just a Bunch Of Keys.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second type of wallet is a **deterministic wallet**, where all the keys are derived from a single master key, known as the seed. All the keys in this type of wallet are related to each other and can be generated again if one has the original seed. There are a number of different key derivation methods used in deterministic wallets. **The most commonly used derivation method uses a tree-like structure and is known as a hierarchical deterministic or HD wallet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To make deterministic wallets slightly more secure against data-loss accidents, such as having your phone stolen, or dropping it in the toilet, **the seeds are often encoded as a list of English words (or words in other languages) for you to write down and use in the event of an accident. Such a list is known as the wallet’s mnemonic code words**. Of course, if someone gets hold of your mnemonic code words, then they can also recreate your wallet and thus gain access to your ether and smart contracts. As such, be very very careful with your recovery word list! \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **Never store the mnemonic electronically, in a file, on your computer or phone. Write it down on paper and store it in a safe and secure place.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few sections introduce each of these technologies at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nondeterministic (Random) Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first Ethereum wallet (produced by the Ethereum pre-sale), each wallet file stored a single randomly generated private key. Such wallets are being replaced with deterministic wallets because these \"old style\" wallets are in many ways inferior. For example, **it is considered good practice to avoid Ethereum address re-use as part of maximizing your privacy while using Ethereum, i.e. using a new address (which needs a new private key) every time you receive funds. You can go further and use a new address after every single transaction, although this can get expensive if you deal a lot with tokens. To follow this practice a nondeterministic wallet will need to regularly increase its list of keys, which means you will need to make regular backups**. If you ever lose your data (disk failure, drink accident, phone stolen) before you’ve managed to back-up your wallet, you lose access to your funds and smart contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"type 0\"** nondeterministic wallets are the hardest to deal with because they create a new wallet file for every new address in a \"just in time\" manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, many Ethereum clients (including geth) use a keystore file, which is a JSON-encoded file that contains a single (randomly generated) private key, encrypted by a passphrase for extra security. The JSON file contents look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/KeystoreFile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The keystore format uses a Key Derivation Function (KDF) also known as a password stretching algorithm, which protects against brute-force, dictionary, or rainbow table attacks.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the private key is not encrypted by the passphrase directly. **Instead, the passphrase is stretched, by repeatedly hashing it. The hashing function is repeated for 262144 rounds, which can be seen in the keystore JSON as parameter crypto.kdfparams.n. An attacker trying to brute-force the passphrase would have to apply 262144 rounds of hashing for every attempted passphrase, which slows down the attack sufficiently as to make it infeasible for passphrases of sufficient complexity and length.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of software libraries that can read and write the keystore format, such as the JavaScript library keythereum: https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **use of nondeterministic wallets is discouraged** for anything other than simple tests. They are too cumbersome to back up and use for anything but the most basic of situations. Instead, **use an industry-standard–based HD wallet with a mnemonic seed for backup.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic, or \"seeded\" wallets are wallets that contain private keys that are all derived from a single seed. The seed is a randomly generated number that is then combined with other data, such as an index number or \"chain code\" to derive any number of private keys**. \n",
    "> In a deterministic wallet, the **seed is sufficient to recover all the derived keys, and therefore a single backup, at creation time, is sufficient to secure all the funds and smart contract access of the wallet. The seed is also sufficient for a wallet export or import**, allowing for easy migration of all the keys between different wallet implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design also makes the **the security of the seed of upmost importance**, as only the seed is needed to gain access to the entire wallet. On the other hand, being able to focus security efforts on a single piece of data can be seen as an advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HD Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic wallets were developed to make it easy to derive many keys from a single seed. Currently, the most advanced form of deterministic wallets is the hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet defined by Bitcoin’s BIP-32 standard. **HD wallets contain keys derived in a tree structure, such that a parent key can derive a sequence of child keys, each of which can derive a sequence of grandchild keys, and so on**. This tree structure is illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/hd_wallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "HD wallets offer several advantages over simpler deterministic wallets:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, **the tree structure can be used to express additional organizational meaning, such as when a specific branch of subkeys is used to receive incoming payments and a different branch is used to receive change from outgoing payments**. Branches of keys can also be used in corporate settings, allocating different branches to departments, subsidiaries, specific functions, or accounting categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second advantage of HD wallets is that **users can create a sequence of public keys without having access to the corresponding private keys. This allows HD wallets to be used on an insecure server or in a watch-only or receive-only capacity**, where the wallet doesn’t have the private keys that can spend the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to encode a private key for secure back-up and retrieval. The currently preferred method is using a sequence of words, which, when taken together in the correct order, can uniquely recreate the private key. This is sometimes known as a mnemonic and the approach has been standardized by BIP-39. **Today, many Ethereum wallets (as well as wallets for other cryptocurrencies) use this standard and can import and export seeds for backup and recovery using interoperable mnemonics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this approach has become popular, let’s have a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A seed for a deterministic wallet, in hex\n",
    "`FCCF1AB3329FD5DA3DA9577511F8F137`\n",
    "\n",
    "A seed for a deterministic wallet, from a 12-word mnemonic:\n",
    "`wolf juice proud gown wool unfair wall cliff insect more detail hub`\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practical terms, the chance of an error when writing down the hex sequence is unexceptably high. In contrast, the list of known words is quite easy to deal with, mainly because there is a high level of redundancy in the writing of words, especially English words.** If \"inzect\" had been recorded by accident, it could quickly be determined, upon the need for wallet recovery, that \"inzect\" is not a valid English word and that \"insect\" should be used instead. We are talking about writing down a representation of the seed because that is good practice when managing HD wallets: **the seed is needed to recover a wallet in the case of data loss (whether through accidents or theft) and so a backup is very prudent. However, the seed must be kept extremely safe and so digital back-ups should be vigorously avoided; hence the advice for a backup using pen and paper.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the use of a recovery word list to encode the seed for an HD wallet makes for the easiest way to safely export, transcribe, record on paper, read without error, and import a private key set into another wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wallet Best Practices\n",
    "As cryptocurrency wallet technology has matured, certain common industry standards have emerged that make bitcoin wallets broadly interoperable, easy to use, secure, and flexible. These common standards are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mnemonic code words**, based on BIP-39\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HD wallets**, based on BIP-32\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multipurpose HD wallet structure**, based on BIP-43\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multicurrency and multiaccount wallets**, based on BIP-44\n",
    "\n",
    "These standards may change or may become obsolete by future developments, but for now they form a set of interlocking technologies that have become the de facto wallet standard for bitcoin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standards have been adopted by a broad range of software and hardware bitcoin wallets, making all these wallets interoperable. A user can export a mnemonic generated on one of these wallets and import it in another wallet, recovering all transactions, keys, and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of software wallets supporting these standards include Jaxx, MetaMask, MyCrypto, and MyEtherWallet (MEW). Examples of hardware wallets supporting these standards include Keepkey, Ledger, and Trezor.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you are implementing an Ethereum wallet, it should be built as a HD wallet, with a seed encoded as mnemonic code for backup, following the BIP-32, BIP-39, BIP-43, and BIP-44 standards, as described in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mnemonic Code Words (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mnemonic code words are word sequences that represent a random number used as a seed to derive a deterministic wallet. The sequence of words is sufficient to re-create the seed and from there re-create the wallet and all the derived keys**. A wallet application that implements deterministic wallets with mnemonic words will show the user a sequence of 12 to 24 words when first creating a wallet. That sequence of words is the wallet backup and can be used to recover and re-create all the keys in the same or any compatible wallet application. Mnemonic words make it easier for users to back up wallets because they are easy to read and correctly transcribe, as compared to a random sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mnemonic words are often confused with **brainwallets**. They are not the same. The primary difference is that a brainwallet consists of words chosen by the user, whereas mnemonic words are created randomly by the wallet and presented to the user. **This important difference makes mnemonic words much more secure, because humans are very poor sources of randomness**. Perhaps more importantly, using the term \"brainwallet\" suggests that the words are to be memorized, which is a terrible idea and a recipe for not having your backup when you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mnemonic codes are defined in BIP-39. Note that BIP-39 is one implementation of a mnemonic code standard. There is a different standard, with a different set of words, used by the Electrum Bitcoin wallet and predating BIP-39. BIP-39 was proposed by the company behind the Trezor hardware wallet and is incompatible with Electrum’s implementation. However, **BIP-39 has now achieved broad industry support across dozens of interoperable implementations and should be considered the de-facto industry standard. Furthermore, BIP-39 can be used to produce multicurrency wallets supporting Ethereum, whereas Electrum seeds cannot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-39 defines the creation of a mnemonic code and seed, which we describe here in nine steps. For clarity, the process is split into two parts: steps 1 through 6 are shown in the image (Mnemonic Words) and steps 7 through 9 are shown in a later image(Mnemonic to Seed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating mnemonic words\n",
    "Mnemonic words are generated automatically by the wallet using the standardized process defined in BIP-39. The wallet starts from a source of entropy, adds a checksum, and then maps the entropy to a word list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a random sequence (entropy) of 128 to 256 bits, say from a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a checksum of the random sequence by taking the first (entropy-length/32, here 128/32) bits of its SHA256 hash.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the checksum to the end of the random sequence.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Split the result into 11-bit length segments.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Map each 11-bit value to a word from the predefined dictionary (BIP39 English Word List) of 2048 words.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The mnemonic code is the sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following depicts how entropy is used to generate mnemonic words:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/GenMnemonicWords.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following shows the relationship between the size of the entropy data and the length of mnemonic codes in words:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Entropy&WordLen.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From mnemonic to seed\n",
    "The mnemonic words represent entropy with a length of 128 to 256 bits. **The entropy is then used to derive a longer (512-bit) seed through the use of the key-stretching function PBKDF2**. The seed produced is then used to build a deterministic wallet and derive its keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key-stretching function takes two parameters: the mnemonic and a salt. **The purpose of a salt in a key-stretching function is to make it difficult to build a lookup table enabling a brute-force attack**. In the BIP-39 standard, the salt has another purpose—it allows the introduction of a passphrase that serves as an additional security factor protecting the seed, as we will describe in more detail under Optional passphrase in BIP-39.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process described in steps 7 through 9 continues from the process described previously in Generating mnemonic words:\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The first parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is the mnemonic produced from step 6.<br><br>\n",
    "8. The second parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is a salt. The salt is composed of the string constant \"mnemonic\" concatenated with an optional user-supplied passphrase string.<br><br>\n",
    "9. PBKDF2 stretches the mnemonic and salt parameters using 2048 rounds of hashing with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm, producing a 512-bit value as its final output. That 512-bit value is the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Mnemonic2Seed.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "The BIP-39 standard allows the use of an optional passphrase in the derivation of the seed. **If no passphrase is used, the mnemonic is stretched with a salt consisting of the constant string \"mnemonic\", producing a specific 512-bit seed from any given mnemonic**. If a passphrase is used, the stretching function produces a different seed from that same mnemonic. In fact, **given a single mnemonic, every possible passphrase leads to a different seed**. All passphrases are valid and they all lead to different seeds, forming a vast set of possible uninitialized wallets. **The set of possible wallets is so large ($2^{512}$) that there is no practical possibility of brute-forcing or accidentally guessing one that is in use.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are no \"wrong\" passphrases in BIP-39. Every passphrase leads to some wallet, which unless previously used will be empty. <br>**Each wallet is characterized by its seed, therefore as different passphrases, when undergo key-stretching function as salts alongside mnemonics, results in different seeds and therefore, we say, different wallets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional passphrase creates two important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A second factor (something memorized) that makes a mnemonic useless on its own, protecting mnemonic backups from compromise by a thief.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A form of plausible deniability or **duress wallet**, where a chosen passphrase leads to a wallet with a small amount of funds used to distract an attacker from the \"real\" wallet that contains the majority of funds, that is, different passphrase as salt with the mnemonic in the key-stretching function would result in different seed which would lead to different private keys which can take charge of different amount of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the use of a passphrase also introduces the risk of loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the wallet owner is incapacitated or dead and no one else knows the passphrase, the seed is useless and all the funds stored in the wallet are lost forever.\n",
    "- Conversely, if the owner backs up the passphrase in the same place as the seed, it defeats the purpose of a second factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**While passphrases are very useful, they should only be used in combination with a carefully planned process for backup and recovery, considering the possibility of surviving the owner and allowing his or her family to recover the cryptocurrency estate.**\n",

    "### Creating an HD Wallet from the Seed\n",
    "\n",
    "HD wallets are created from a single root seed, which is a 128-, 256-, or 512-bit random number. Most commonly, this seed is generated from a mnemonic as detailed in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every key in the HD wallet is deterministically derived from this root seed, which makes it possible to re-create the entire HD wallet from that seed in any compatible HD wallet**. This makes it easy to export, back up, restore, and import HD wallets containing thousands or even millions of keys by simply transferring only the mnemonic that the root seed is derived from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most HD wallets follow the BIP-32 standard, which has become a de-facto industry standard for deterministic key generation. You can read the detailed specification in: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We won’t be discussing the details of BIP-32 here, only the components necessary to understand how it is used in wallets. \n",
    "> **For in depth look read (recommended) the following section from Mastering Bitcoin**: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/parsh24/Blockchain/blob/master/Mastering%20Bitcoin/Mastering%20Bitcoin.ipynb#Creating-an-HD-Wallet-from-the-Seed\n",
    "\n",
    "The main important aspect is the tree-like hierarchical relationships that is possible for the derived keys to have, as you can see below. We will also need to understand the idea of extended keys and hardened keys, which are explained in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HD-Wallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are dozens of interoperable implementations of BIP-32 offered in many software libraries:\n",

    "There is also a **BIP-32 standalone web page generator** that is very useful for testing and experimentation with BIP-32: http://bip32.org/\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Extended public and private keys\n",
    "\n",
    "In BIP-32 terminology, **keys can be \"extended\" so that they can produce \"children\". In this way, keys become extended keys.** With the right mathematical operations, extended \"parent\" keys can be used to derive \"child\" keys and thus produce the tree hierarchy of keys and addresses we have been talking about earlier in this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A parent key doesn’t have to be at the top of the tree. They can be picked out from anywhere in the tree hierarchy. \"Extending\" a key involves taking the key itself and appending a special \"chain code\" to it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the key is a private key, it is an extended private key distinguished by the prefix **xprv**:<br>\n",
    "`xprv9s21ZrQH143K2JF8RafpqtKiTbsbaxEeUaMnNHsm5o6wCW3z8ySyH4UxFVSfZ8n7ESu7fgir8imbZKLYVBxFPND1pniTZ81vKfd45EHKX73`\n",
    "\n",
    "An extended public key is distinguished by the prefix **xpub**:<br>\n",
    "`xpub661MyMwAqRbcEnKbXcCqD2GT1di5zQxVqoHPAgHNe8dv5JP8gWmDproS6kFHJnLZd23tWevhdn4urGJ6b264DfTGKr8zjmYDjyDTi9U7iyT`\n",
    "\n",
    "A very useful characteristic of HD wallets is the ability to derive child public keys from parent public keys, without having the private keys. **This gives us two ways to derive a child public key**:\n",
    "- either directly from the child private key, \n",
    "- or from the parent public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extended public key can be used, therefore, to derive all of the public keys (and only the public keys) in that branch of the HD wallet structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This shortcut can be used to create very secure public key–only deployments where a server or application has a copy of an extended public key and no private keys whatsoever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public keys and Ethereum addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those addresses. Meanwhile, on another, more secure server, the extended private key can derive all the corresponding private keys to sign transactions and spend the money.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**One common application of this solution is to install an extended public key on a web server that serves an e-commerce application.** The web server can use the public key derivation function to create a new Ethereum address for every transaction (e.g., for a customer shopping cart). The web server will not have any private keys that would be vulnerable to theft. Without HD wallets, the only way to do this is to generate thousands of Ethereum addresses on a separate secure server and then preload them on the e-commerce server. That approach is cumbersome and requires constant maintenance to ensure that the e-commerce server doesn’t \"run out\" of keys. Hence the preference to use extended public keys from HD wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another common application of this solution is for cold-storage or hardware wallets**. In that scenario, the extended private key can be stored on a hardware wallet, while the extended public key can be kept online. The user can create \"receive\" addresses at will, while the private keys are safely stored offline. To spend the funds, the user can use the extended private key on an offline signing Ethereum client or sign transactions on the hardware wallet device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardened child key derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to derive a branch of public keys from an xpub (extended public key) is very useful, but it comes with a potential risk. Access to an xpub does not give access to child private keys. However, **because the xpub contains the chain code (used to derive child public keys from the parent public key), if a child private key is known, or somehow leaked, it can be used with the chain code to derive all the other child private keys. A single leaked child private key, together with a parent chain code, reveals all the private keys of all the children. Worse, the child private key together with a parent chain code can be used to deduce the parent private key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter this risk, HD wallets use an alternative derivation function called hardened derivation, which \"breaks\" the relationship between parent public key and child chain code. **The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a \"firewall\" in the parent/child sequence, with a chain code that cannot be used to compromise a parent or sibling private key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, if you want to use the convenience of an xpub to derive branches of public keys, without exposing yourself to the risk of a leaked chain code, you should derive it from a hardened parent, rather than a normal parent. **Best practice is to have the level-1 children of the master keys always derived through the hardened derivation, to prevent compromise of the master keys.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index numbers for normal and hardened derivation\n",
    "The index number used in the derivation function is a 32-bit integer. To easily distinguish between keys derived through the normal derivation function versus keys derived through hardened derivation, this index number is split into two ranges. **Index numbers between 0 and $2^{31}$ – 1 (0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF) are used only for normal derivation. Index numbers between $2^{31}$ and $2^{32}$ - 1 (0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF) are used only for hardened derivation**. Therefore, if the index number is less than $2^{31}$, the child is normal, whereas if the index number is equal or above $2^{31}$, the child is hardened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make the index number easier to read and display, the index number for hardened children is displayed starting from zero, but with a prime symbol**. The first normal child key is therefore displayed as 0, whereas the first hardened child (index 0x80000000) is displayed as 0&#x27;. In sequence then, the second hardened key would have index 0x80000001 and would be displayed as 1&#x27;, and so on. When you see an HD wallet index i&#x27;, that means $2^{31}$+i.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HD wallet key identifier (path)\n",
    "Keys in an HD wallet are identified using a \"path\" naming convention, with each level of the tree separated by a slash (/) character (see HD wallet path examples). Private keys derived from the master private key start with \"m.\" Public keys derived from the master public key start with \"M.\" Therefore, the first child private key of the master private key is m/0. The first child public key is M/0. The second grandchild of the first child is m/0/1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**The \"ancestry\" of a key is read from right to left, until you reach the master key from which it was derived**.<br>\n",
    "For example, identifier m/x/y/z describes the key that is the z-th child of key m/x/y, which is the y-th child of key m/x, which is the x-th child of m.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HDWalletPathEx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating the HD wallet tree structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The HD wallet tree structure offers tremendous flexibility. Each parent extended key can have 4 billion children: 2 billion normal children and 2 billion hardened children. Each of those children can have another 4 billion children, and so on. The tree can be as deep as you want, with an infinite number of generations. With all that flexibility, however, it becomes quite difficult to navigate this infinite tree. **It is especially difficult to transfer HD wallets between implementations, because the possibilities for internal organization into branches and subbranches are endless.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two BIPs, BIP-43 and BIP-44, offer a solution to this complexity by creating some proposed standards for the structure of HD wallet trees**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-43 proposes the use of the first hardened child index as a special identifier that signifies the \"purpose\" of the tree structure**. Based on BIP-43, an HD wallet should use only one level-1 branch of the tree, with the index number identifying the structure and namespace of the rest of the tree by defining its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an HD wallet using only branch m/i&#x27;/ is intended to signify a specific purpose and that purpose is identified by index number \"i\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extending that specification, BIP-44 proposes a multi-account structure as \"purpose\" number 44' under BIP-43**. All HD wallets following the BIP-44 structure are identified by the fact that they only used one branch of the tree: m/44'/.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-44 specifies the structure as consisting of five predefined tree levels:<br>\n",
    "`m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **first-level \"purpose\"** is always set to 44' signifying **multi-currency/multi-account structure**. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **second-level \"coin_type\" specifies the type of cryptocurrency coin**, allowing for multicurrency HD wallets where each currency has its own subtree under the second level. There are three currencies defined for now: Bitcoin is m/44'/0', Bitcoin Testnet is m/44&#x27;/1&#x27;, and Litecoin is m/44&#x27;/2&#x27;. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **third level of the tree is \"account,\" which allows users to subdivide their wallets into separate logical subaccounts**, for accounting or organizational purposes. For example, an HD wallet might contain two bitcoin \"accounts\": m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27; and m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/1&#x27;. Each account is the root of its own subtree. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the **fourth level, \"change,\" an HD wallet has two subtrees, one for creating receiving addresses and one for creating change addresses**. Note that whereas the previous levels used hardened derivation, this level uses normal derivation. This is to allow this level of the tree to export extended public keys for use in a nonsecured environment.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- Usable addresses are derived by the HD wallet as children of the fourth level, making the **fifth level of the tree the \"address_index\"**. This is the level from where we start generating keys in order to derive addresses. For example, the third receiving address for bitcoin payments in the primary account would be M/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27;/0/2. \n",

    "# Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions are signed messages originated by an externally owned account, transmitted by the Ethereum network, and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.** Behind that basic definition, there are a lot of surprising and fascinating details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another way to look at transactions is that they are the only thing that can trigger a change of state or cause a contract to execute in the EVM. Ethereum is a global singleton state machine, and transactions are the only thing that can make that state machine \"tick\", changing its state.** Contracts don’t run on their own. Ethereum doesn’t run \"in the background\". **Everything starts with a transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will dissect transactions, show how they work, and understand the details. Note that much of this chapter is addressed to those who are interested in managing their own transactions at a low level, e.g. because they are writing a wallet app; you don’t have to worry about this if you are happy using existing wallet applications, although you may find the details interesting, of course!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "First let’s take a look at the basic structure of a transaction, as it is serialized and transmitted on the Ethereum network. **Each client and application that receives a serialized transaction will store it in-memory using its own internal data structure, perhaps embellished with metadata that doesn’t exist in the network serialized transaction itself. The network serialization of a transaction is, therefore, the only common standard of a transaction’s structure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction is a serialized binary message that contains the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **nonce**<br>\n",
    "A sequence number, issued by the originating EOA, used to prevent message replay.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gas price**<br>\n",
    "The price of gas (in wei) the originator is willing to pay.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gas limit**<br>\n",
    "The maximum amount of gas the originator is willing to buy for this transaction.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **to**<br>\n",
    "Destination Ethereum address.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **value**<br>\n",
    "Amount of ether to send to the destination.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **data**<br>\n",
    "Variable length binary data payload.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **v,r,s**<br>\n",
    "The three components of an ECDSA digital signature of the originating EOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The transaction message’s structure is serialized using the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding scheme, which was created specifically for accurate and byte-perfect data serialization in Ethereum**. All numbers in Ethereum are encoded as big-endian integers, of lengths that are multiples of 8 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that the field labels (\"to\", \"gas limit\", etc.) are shown here for clarity, but are not part of the transaction serialized data, which contains the field values RLP-encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, RLP does not contain any field delimiters or labels. **RLP’s length prefix is used to identify the length of each field. Anything beyond the defined length, therefore, belongs to the next field in the structure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is the actual transaction structure transmitted, **most internal representations and user interface visualizations embellish this with additional information**, derived from the transaction or from the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may notice there is **no \"from\" data in the address identifying the originator EOA**. <br>\n",
    "That is because the **EOA’s public key can be derived from the v,r,s components of the ECDSA signature. The address can, in turn, be derived from the public key.** When you see a transaction showing a \"from\" field, that was added by the software used to visualize the transaction. **Other metadata frequently added to the transaction by client software include the block number (once it is mined and included in the blockchain) and a transaction ID (calculated hash**). Again, this data is derived from the transaction and not part of the transaction message itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The transaction nonce\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonce is one of the most important and least understood components of a transaction. The definition in the Yellow Paper reads:<br>\n",
    "**\"nonce: A scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent from this address or, in the case of accounts with associated code, the number of contract-creations made by this account.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, **the nonce is an attribute of the originating address, i.e. it only has meaning in the context of the sending address**. However, the nonce is not stored explicitly as part of an account’s state on the blockchain. Instead **it is calculated dynamically, by counting the number of confirmed transactions that have originated from an address**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two scenarios where the existence of a transaction counting nonce is important: \n",
    "- the usability feature of **transactions being included in the order they are created**; and \n",
    "- the vital feature of **transaction duplication protection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example scenario for each of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imagine you wish to make two transactions. You have an important payment to make of 6 ether, and also another payment of 8 ether. You sign and broadcast the 6 ether transaction first, because it is the more important one, and then you sign and broadcast the second, 8 ether transaction. Sadly, you have overlooked the fact that this account of yours has only 10 ether, so the network can’t accept both transactions. One of them will fail. Because you sent the more important 6 ether one first, you understandably expect that one to go through and the 8 ether one to be rejected. However, in a decentralized system like Ethereum, nodes may receive the transactions in either order; there is no guarantee that a particular node will have one transaction propagated to it before the other. As such, it will almost certainly be the case that some nodes receive the 6 ether transaction first and others receive the 8 ether transaction first. **Without the nonce, it would be random as to which one gets accepted and which rejected. However, with the nonce included, the first transaction you sent will have the correct nonce, let’s say it is 3, signifying that it is next in line to be processed. The 8 ether transaction has the next nonce value, i.e. 4, and so will be ignored until your account shows up to have officially processed all the transactions with nonces from 0 to 3, even if the 8 ether transaction is received first. Phew!**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now imagine you have an account with 100 ether. Fantastic! You find someone on-line who will accept payment in ether for a mcguffin-widget that you really want to buy. You send them 2 ether and they send you the mcguffin-widget. Lovely. To make that 2 ether payment, you signed a transaction sending 2 ether from your account to their account, and then broadcast it to the Ethereum network to be verified and included on the blockchain. **Now, without a nonce value in the transaction, a second transaction sending 2 ether to the same address a second time will look exactly the same as the first transaction. This would mean that anyone who saw your transaction on the Ethereum network (which means everyone, including the recipient, or your enemies) can \"replay\" the transaction again and again and again until all your ether is gone simply by copy-and-pasting your original transaction and resending it to the network. However, with the nonce value included in the transaction data, every single transaction is unique, even when sending the same amount of ether to the send recipient address multiple times**. This means that, by having the incrementing nonce as part of the transaction, it is simply no possible for anyone to \"duplicate\" a payment you have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, <u>it is important to note that the use of the nonce is actually vital for an account based protocol</u>, in contrast to the \"UTXO\" mechanism of the bitcoin protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keeping track of nonces\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, the nonce is an up-to-date count of the number of confirmed (i.e. on-chain) transactions that have originated from an account. To find out what the nonce is, you can interrogate the blockchain, for example via the web3 interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving the transaction count of our example address<br>\n",
    "`web3.eth.getTransactionCount(\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\")`<br>\n",
    "`40`\n",
    "\n",
    "> The nonce is a zero-based counter, meaning the first transaction has nonce 0. In above example address, we have a transaction count of 40, meaning nonces 0 through 39 have been seen. The next transaction’s nonce will need to be 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your wallet will keep track of nonces for each address it manages. It’s fairly simple to do that, as long as you are only originating transactions from a single point. Let’s say you are writing your own wallet software or some other application that originates transactions. **How do you track nonces?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you create a new transaction, you assign the next nonce in the sequence. But until it is confirmed, it will not count towards the `getTransactionCount` total.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Be careful when using the getTransactionCount function for counting pending transactions, because you might run into some problems if you send a few transactions in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Multi-getTransacEx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the first transaction we sent increased the transaction count to 41, showing the pending transaction. **But when we sent 3 more transactions in quick succession, the getTransactionCount call didn’t count them. It only counted one, even though you might expect there to be 3 pending in the mempool. If we wait a few seconds to allow for network communications to settle down, the getTransactionCount call will return the expected number**. But in the interim, while there are more than one transactions pending, it might not help us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you build an application that constructs transactions, it cannot rely on getTransactionCount for pending transactions.** Only when pending and confirmed are equal (all outstanding transactions are confirmed) can you trust the output of getTransactionCount to start your nonce counter. Thereafter, keep track of the nonce in your application until each transaction confirms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parity’s JSON RPC interface offers the parity_nextNonce function, that returns the next nonce that should be used in a transaction.** The parity_nextNonce function counts nonces correctly, even if you construct several transactions in rapid succession, without confirming them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Parity has a web console for accessing the JSON RPC interface, but here we are using a command line HTTP client to access it\n",
    "\n",
    "`curl --data '{\"method\":\"parity_nextNonce\",\"params\":[\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\"],\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}' -H` `\"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST localhost:8545`\n",
    "\n",
    "`{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":\"0x32\",\"id\":1}`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaps in nonces, duplicate nonces, and confirmation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep track of nonces if you are creating transactions programmatically, especially if you are doing so from multiple independent processes simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Ethereum network processes transactions sequentially, based on the nonce. That means that if you transmit a transaction with nonce 0 and then transmit a transaction with nonce 2, the second transaction will not be included in any blocks. It will be stored in the mempool, while the Ethereum network waits for the missing nonce to appear**. All nodes will assume that the missing nonce has simply been delayed and that the transaction with nonce 2 was received out-of-sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you then transmit a transaction with the missing nonce 1, both transactions (nonces 1 and 2) will be processed and included (if valid, of course). **Once you fill the gap, the network can mine the out-of-sequence transaction that it held in the mempool.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means is that if you create several transactions in sequence and one of them does not get officially included in any blocks, all the subsequent transactions will be \"stuck\", waiting for the missing nonce**. A transaction can create an inadvertent **\"gap\"** in the nonce sequence because it is invalid or has insufficient gas. To get things moving again, you have to transmit a valid transaction with the missing nonce. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You should be equally mindful that once a tx with the \"missing\" nonce is validated by the network, all the broadcast transactions with subsequent nonces will incrementally become valid; **it is not possible to \"recall\" a transaction!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If on the other hand you accidentally duplicate a nonce**, for example by transmitting two transactions with the same nonce, but different recipients or values, then one of them will be confirmed and one will be rejected. **Which one is confirmed will be determined by the sequence in which they arrive at the first validating node that receives them, i.e. it will be fairly random.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, keeping track of nonces is necessary and if your application doesn’t manage that process correctly, you will run into problems. Unfortunately, things get even more difficult if you are trying to do this concurrently, as we will see in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concurrency, transaction origination, and nonces\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency is a complex aspect of computer science, and it crops up unexpectedly sometimes, especially in decentralized and distributed real-time systems like Ethereum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple terms, concurrency is when you have simultaneous computation by multiple independent systems. These can be in the same program (e.g. threading), on the same CPU (e.g. multi-processing), or on different computers (i.e. distributed systems). Ethereum, by definition, is a system that allows concurrency of operations (nodes, clients, DApps), but enforces a singleton state through consensus.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine that we have multiple independent wallet applications that are generating transactions from the same address or addresses. One example of such a situation would be an exchange processing withdrawals from the exchange’s hot wallet. Ideally, you’d want to have more than one computer processing withdrawals, so that it doesn’t become a bottleneck or single point of failure. However, this quickly becomes problematic, **as having more than one computer producing withdrawals will result in some thorny concurrency problems, not least of which is the selection of nonces**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How do multiple computers generating, signing and broadcasting transactions from the same hot wallet account coordinate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You could use a single computer to assign nonces, on a first-come first-served basis to computers signing transactions.** However, this computer is now a single point of failure. Worse, if several nonces are assigned and one of them never gets used (because of a failure in the computer processing the transaction with that nonce), all of the subsequent ones get stuck.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Another approach would be to generate the transactions, but not assign a nonce to them** (and therefore leave them unsigned - remember that the nonce is an integral part of the transaction data and therefore needs to be included in the digital signature that authenticates the transaction). **Then queue them to a single node that signs them and also keeps track of nonces**. Again, this would be a pitch-point in the process: **the signing and tracking of nonces is the part of your operation that is likely to become congested under load, whereas the generation of the unsigned transaction is the part you don’t really need to parallelize.** You would have some concurrency, but you don’t have it in any useful part of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the end, these concurrency problems, on top of the difficulty of tracking account balances and transaction confirmations in independent processes, force most implementations towards avoiding concurrency and creating bottlenecks** such as a single process handling all withdrawal transactions in an exchange, or setting up multiple hot wallets that can work completely independently for withdrawals and only need to be intermittently re-balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction gas\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss gas in detail in later. However, let’s cover some basics about the role of the gasPrice and gasLimit components of a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas is the fuel of Ethereum. Gas is not ether - it’s a separate virtual currency with its own exchange rate against ether. Ethereum uses gas to control the amount of resources that a transaction can use, since it will be processed on thousands of computers around the world**. The open-ended (Turing complete) computation model requires some form of metering in order to avoid denial of service attacks or inadvertent resource-devouring transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas is separate from ether in order to protect the system from the volatility that might arise along with rapid changes in the value of ether, and also as a way to manage the important and sensitive ratios between the costs of the various resources that gas pays for (namely, computation, memory and storage).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas Price**<br>\n",
    "The `gasPrice` field in a transaction **allows the transaction originator to set the exchange rate of each unit of gas that they are willing to pay**. Gas price is measured in wei per gas unit. For example, in a transaction we recently created, our wallet had set the gasPrice to 3 Gwei (3 Giga-wei or 3 billion wei).\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular site **ethgasstation.info** provides information on the current prices of gas, and other relevant gas metrics for the Ethereum main network: https://ethgasstation.info/\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallets can adjust the gasPrice in transactions they originate, to achieve faster confirmation of transactions. **The higher the gasPrice, the faster the transaction is likely to confirm. Conversely, lower priority transactions can carry a reduced price, resulting in slower confirmation**. The minimum value that gasPrice that can be set to is zero, which means a fee-free transaction. During periods of low demand for space in a block, such transactions might very well get mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The minimum acceptable gasPrice is zero. That means that wallets can generate completely free transactions**. Depending on capacity, these may never be confirmed, but there is nothing in the protocol that prohibits free transactions. You can find several examples of such transactions successfully included on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web3 interface offers a gasPrice suggestion, by calculating a median price across several blocks:<br>\n",
    "`truffle(mainnet)> web3.eth.getGasPrice(console.log)`<br>\n",
    "`truffle(mainnet)> null BigNumber { s: 1, e: 10, c: [ 10000000000 ] }`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gas Limit**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important field related to gas, is `gasLimit`. **In simple terms, gasLimit defines how the maximum number of units of gas the transaction originator is willing to buy in order to complete the transaction**. For simple payments, meaning transactions that transfer ether from one EOA to another EOA, the gas amount needed is fixed at **21,000 gas units**. To calculate how much ether that will cost, you multiply 21,000 with the gasPrice you’re willing to pay:\n",
    "\n",
    "`truffle(mainnet)> web3.eth.getGasPrice(function(err, res) {console.log(res*21000)} )`<br>\n",
    "`truffle(mainnet)> 210000000000000`\n",
    "\n",
    "**If your transaction’s destination address is a contract, then the amount of gas needed can be estimated but cannot be determined with accuracy. That’s because a contract can evaluate different conditions that lead to different execution paths, with different total gas costs**. That means that the contract may execute only a simple computation or a more complex one depending on conditions that are outside of your control and cannot be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this let’s look at an example: <br>\n",
    "We can write a smart contract that increments a counter each time it is called and executes a particular loop a number of times equal to the call count. Maybe on the 100th call it gives out a special price that needs extra calculations. If you call the contract 99 times one thing happens, but on the 100th something very different happens. The amount of gas you would pay for that depends on how many other transactions have called that function before your transaction is included in a block. Perhaps your estimate is based on being the 99th transaction and just before your transaction is confirmed, someone else calls the contract for the 99th time. Now you’re the 100th transaction to call and the computation effort (and gas cost) is much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "To borrow a common analogy used in Ethereum, you can think of gasLimit as the fuel tank in your car (your car is the transaction). You fill the tank with as much gas as you think it will need for the journey (the computation needed to validate your transaction). You can estimate the amount to some degree, but there might be unexpected changes to your journey such as a diversion (a more complex execution path), which increase fuel consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analogy to a fuel tank is somewhat misleading, however. It’s actually more like a credit account for a gas station company, where you pay after the trip is completed, based on how much gas you actually used. **When you transmit your transaction, one of the first validation steps is to check that the account it originated from has enough ether to pay the gasPrice * gas fee. But the amount is not actually deducted from your account until the end of the transaction execution. You are only billed for gas actually consumed by your transaction at the end, but you have to have enough balance for the maximum amount you are willing to pay before you send your transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction recipient\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipient of a transaction is specified in the to field. **This contains a 20-byte Ethereum address. The address can be an EOA or a contract address.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum does no further validation of this field. Any 20-byte value is considered valid. **If the 20-byte value corresponds to an address without a corresponding private key, or without a corresponding contract, the transaction is still valid**. Ethereum has no way of knowing whether an address was correctly derived from a public key (and therefore from a private key) in existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning:\n",
    "> **The Ethereum protocol does not validate recipient addresses in transactions. You can send to an address that has no corresponding private key or contract, thereby \"burning\" the ether, rendering it forever unspendable.** Validation should be done at the user interface level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending a transaction to the wrong address will probably burn the ether sent, rendering it forever inaccessible (unspendable), since most addresses do not have a known private key and therefore no signature can be generated to spend it. **It is assumed that validation of the address happens at the user interface level (see EIP-55 or ICAP)**. In fact, there are a number of valid reasons for burning ether, including as a game-theory disincentive to cheating in payment channels and other smart contracts, and, **since the amount of ether is finite, burning ether effectively distributes the value burned to all ether holders (in proportion to the amount of ether they hold).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction value and data\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main \"payload\" of a transaction is contained in two fields: value and data.**<br>\n",
    "Transactions can have: \n",
    "- both value and data; \n",
    "- only value; \n",
    "- only data; \n",
    "- or neither value nor data. \n",
    "\n",
    "All four combinations are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A transaction with only value is a payment. A transaction with only data is an invocation. A transaction with neither value nor data - well that’s probably just a waste of gas! But it is still possible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try all of the above combinations:\n",

    "### Transmitting value to EOAs and contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you construct an Ethereum transaction that contains value, it is the equivalent of a payment. These transactions will behave differently depending on whether the destination address is a contract or not.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For EOA addresses, or rather for any address that isn’t flagged as a contract on the blockchain, Ethereum will record a state change, adding the value you sent to the balance of the address**.

    "\n",
    "- **If the destination address (to) is a contract, then the EVM will execute the contract.** \n",
    "    - As most contracts follow the ABI specification, it will likely attempt to call the function named in the data payload of your transaction. \n",
    "    - If there is no data payload in your transaction, the contract will probably call its fallback function and, if that function is payable, will execute it to determine what to do next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A contract can reject incoming payments by throwing an exception** immediately when a function is called, or as determined by conditions coded in a function. **If the function terminated successfully (without an exception), then the contract’s state is updated to reflect an increase in the contract’s ether balance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transmitting a data payload to an EOA or contract\n",
    "\n",
    "When your transaction contains a data payload, it is most likely addressed to a contract address. That doesn’t mean you cannot send a data payload to an EOA - that is completely valid in the Ethereum protocol. **However, in that case, the interpretation of the data payload is up to the wallet you use to access the EOA. It is totally ignored by the Ethereum protocol. Most wallets also ignore any data payload received in a transaction to an EOA they control. In the future, it is possible that standards may emerge that allow wallets to interpret data payload encodings the way contracts do**, thereby allowing transactions to invoke functions running inside user wallets. **The critical difference is that any interpretation of the data payload by an EOA is not subject to Ethereum’s consensus rules, unlike a contract execution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, **let’s assume your transaction is delivering a data payload to a contract address. In that case, the data payload will be interpreted by the EVM as contract invocation. Most contracts use this data more specifically as a function invocation, calling the named function and passing any encoded arguments to the function.**\n",

    "There is one special case of a transaction: contract creation. This is a transaction that creates a new contract on the blockchain, deploying for future use. **Contract creation transactions are sent to a special destination address: the zero address. In simple terms, the to field in a contract registration transaction contains the address 0x0.

    "\n",
    "So far, we have not delved into any detail about \"digital signatures\". In this section, **we look at how digital signatures work and how they can present proof of ownership of a private key without revealing that private key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital signature algorithm used in Ethereum is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA. ECDSA is the algorithm used for digital signatures based on elliptic curve private/public key pairs, as described in earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **digital signature serves three purposes in Ethereum** (see the following sidebar):\n",
    "- First, the signature **proves that the owner of the private key, who is by implication the owner of an Ethereum account, has authorized the spending of ether, or execution of a contract.** <br><br>\n",
    "- Secondly, **the proof of authorization is undeniable (non-repudiation)**. <br><br>\n",
    "- Thirdly, the signature **proves that the transaction data have not and cannot be modified by anyone after the transaction has been signed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia’s Definition of a \"Digital Signature\":\n",
    "> A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or documents. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (non-repudiation), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Digital Signatures Work\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital signature is a mathematical scheme that consists of two parts. \n",
    "- The first part is an **algorithm for creating a signature, using a private key (the signing key) from a message** (which in our case is the transaction). \n",
    "- The second part is an **algorithm that allows anyone to verify the signature by only using the message and a public key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a digital signature\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ethereum’s implementation of ECDSA, **the \"message\" being signed is the transaction, or more accurately, the Keccak256 hash of the RLP-encoded data from the transaction. The signing key is the EOA’s private key**. The result is the signature:<br>\n",
    "$Sig=F_{sig}(F_{keccha256}(m),k)$\n",

    "where:<br>\n",
    "k is the signing private key<br>\n",

    "Sig is the resulting signature\n",
    "\n",
    "The function Fsig produces a signature Sig that is composed of two values, commonly referred to as R and S: `Sig = (R, S)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verifying the Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "**To verify the signature, one must have the signature (R and S), the serialized transaction, and the public key** (that corresponds to the private key used to create the signature). Essentially, verification of a signature means \"Only the owner of the private key that generated this public key could have produced this signature on this transaction\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**The signature verification algorithm takes the message (i.e. a hash of the transaction for our usage), the signer’s public key and the signature (R and S values), and returns TRUE if the signature is valid for this message and public key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ECDSA Math\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, signatures are created by a mathematical function F_{sig} that produces a signature composed of two values R and S. In this section we look at the function F_{sig} in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signature algorithm first generates an ephemeral (temporary) private key in a cryptographically secure way. **This temporary key is used in the calculation of the R and S values to ensure that the sender’s actual private key can’t be calculated by attackers watching signed transactions on the Ethereum network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we known from, the ephemeral private key is used to derive the corresponding (ephemeral) public key, so we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A cryptographically secure random number q, which is used as the ephemeral private key, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the corresponding ephemeral public key Q, generated from q and the elliptic curve generator point G (that is, $Q = q*G$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **R value of the digital signature is then the x coordinate of the ephemeral public key Q.**\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, the algorithm calculates the S value of the signature, such that:<br>\n",
    "$S ≡ q^{-1} (Keccak256(m) + R * k)(mod p)$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Transaction signing in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce a valid transaction, the originator must apply a digital signature to the message, using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature algorithm. **When we say \"sign the transaction\", we actually mean \"sign the Keccak256 hash of the RLP serialized transaction data\". The signature is applied to the hash of the transaction data, not the transaction itself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To sign a transaction in Ethereum, the originator must:**\n",
    "- **Create a transaction data structure**, containing nine fields: nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, chainID, 0, 0<br><br>\n",
    "- **Produce an RLP-encoded serialized message of the transaction data structure**<br><br>\n",
    "- **Compute the Keccak256 hash** of this serialized message<br><br>\n",
    "- **Compute the ECDSA signature**, signing the hash with the originating EOA’s private key<br><br>\n",
    "- **Append the ECDSA signature’s computed v, r and s values** in the transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**The special signature variable v indicates two things: the chain ID and the recovery identifier to help the ECDSA recover function check the signature**. It is calculated as either one of 27 or 28, or as the chain ID doubled plus 35 or 36. For more information on the chain ID, see Raw transaction creation with EIP-155. The recovery identifier (27 or 28 in the \"old style\" signatures, or 35 or 36 in the full \"Spurious Dragon\" style transactions) is used to indicate the parity of the y component of the public key (see The signature prefix value (v) and public key recovery for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **At block # 2,675,000, Ethereum implemented the \"Spurious Dragon\" hard fork that, among other changes, introduced a new signing scheme that includes transaction replay protection** (preventing transactions meant for one network being replayed on others). This new signing scheme is specified in **EIP-155**. **This change affects the form of the transaction and its signature, so attention must be paid to the first of the three signature variables (i.e. v) which takes one of two forms and indicates the data fields included in the transaction message being hashed.**\n",

This ensures that transactions created for one blockchain** (e.g. Ethereum main network) **are invalid on another blockchain** (e.g. Ethereum Classic or Ropsten test network). Therefore, <u>transactions broadcast on one network cannot be replayed on another, hence the \"replay attack protection\" name of the standard</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EIP-155 adds three fields to the main six fields of the transaction data structure, namely the chain identifier, 0, and 0. These three fields are added to the transaction data before it is encoded and hashed. The three additional fields therefore change the transaction’s hash, to which the signature is later applied**. By including the chain identifier in the data being signed, the transaction signature prevents any changes, as the signature is invalidated if the chain identifier is modified. Therefore, **EIP-155 makes it impossible for a transaction to be replayed on another chain, because the signature’s validity depends on the chain identifier.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain identifier field takes a value according to network the transaction is meant for:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ChainID-Values.png)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### The signature prefix value (v) and public key recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in Structure of Transaction, the transaction message doesn’t include any \"from\" field. That’s because the originator’s public key can be computed directly from the ECDSA signature. Once you have the public key, you can compute the address easily. **The process of recovering the signer’s public key is called a Public Key Recovery.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the values r and s, that were computed in ECDSA Math, we can compute two possible public keys.\n",

    "\n",
    "- From r, we also calculate $r^{-1}$ which is the multiplicative inverse of r.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally we calculate z, which is the n-lowest bits of the message hash, where n is the order of the elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two possible public keys are then:<br>\n",
    "- $K_{1}$ = $r^{-1}$(sR - zG)<br>\n",
    "- $K_{2}$ = $r^{-1}$(sR' - zG)\n",

    "- R and R' are the two possibilities for the ephemeral public key Q\n",
    "- z are the n-lowest bits of the message hash\n",
    "- G is the elliptic curve generator point\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things more efficient, **the transaction signature includes a prefix value v, which tells us which of the two possible R values are the ephemeral public key. If v is even, then R is the correct value. If v is odd, then it is R'. That way, we need to calculate only one value for R and only one value for K.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Separating signing and transmission (offline signing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a transaction is signed, it is ready to transmit to the Ethereum network. **The three steps of creating, signing, and broadcasting a transaction normally happen as a single operation, for example using web3.eth.sendTransaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, as we saw in Raw transaction creation and signing, you can create and sign the transaction in two separate steps.** Once you have a signed transaction, you can then transmit it using `web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction` which takes a hex-encoded and signed transaction and transmits it on the Ethereum network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why would you want to separate the signing and transmission of transactions?**<br>\n",
    "The most common reason is **security: the computer that signs a transaction must have unlocked private keys loaded in memory. The computer that does the transmiting must be connected to the internet (and be running an Ethereum client). If these two functions are on one computer, then you have private keys on an online system, which is quite dangerous**. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Separating the functions of signing and transmitting and performing them on different machines (on an offline and online device, respectively) is called **offline signing** and is a common security practice. The full procedure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creation**: can be using an online or offline device, but online is easier because the current state of the account to be used can be checked, notably the current nonce and funds available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Signing**: transfer the constructed transaction to an \"air-gapped\" offline device for transaction signing, e.g. via QR code scanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transmission**: transfer the signed transaction (back) to an online device for broadcasting on the Ethereum client, e.g. via QR scanning or USB memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depending on the level of security you need, your \"offline signing\" computer can have varying degrees of separation from the online computer, ranging from an isolated and firewalled subnet (online but segregated) to a completely offline system known as an air-gapped system**. In an air-gapped system there is no network connectivity at all - the computer is separated from the online environment by a gap of \"air\". **To sign transactions you transfer them to and from the air-gapped computer using data storage media or (better) a webcam and QR code**. Of course, this means you must manually transfer every transaction you want signed, and this doesn’t scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not many environments can utilize a fully air-gapped system, even a small degree of isolation has significant security benefits. For example, an isolated subnet with a firewall that only allows a message-queue protocol through, can offer a much-reduced attack surface and much higher security than signing on the online system. **Many companies use a protocol such as ZeroMQ (0MQ), as it offers a reduced attack surface for the signing computer**. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a setup like that, transactions are serialized and queued for signing:\n",
    "- The queuing protocol transmits the serialized message, in a way similar to a TCP socket, to the signing computer. \n",
    "- The signing computer reads the serialized transactions from the queue (carefully), applies a signature with the appropriate key, and places them on an outgoing queue. \n",
    "- The outgoing queue transmits the signed transactions to a computer with an Ethereum client that de-queues them and transmits them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Ethereum network uses a \"flood\" routing protocol. Each Ethereum client, acts as a node in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, which (ideally) forms a mesh network. No network node is \"special\": they all act as equal peers**. We will use the term \"node\" to refer to an Ethereum client that is connected to and participates in the P2P network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction propagation starts with:\n",
    "- The originating Ethereum node creating (or receiving from offline) a signed transaction. <br><br>\n",
    "- The transaction is validated and then transmitted to all the other Ethereum nodes that are directly connected to the originating node. On average, each Ethereum node maintains connections to at least 13 other nodes, called its neighbors.<br><br>\n",
    "- Each neighbor node validates the transaction as soon as they receive it. If they agree that it is valid, they store a copy and propagate it to all their neighbors (except the one it came from). <br><br>\n",
    "- As a result, **the transaction ripples outwards from the originating node, flooding across the network, until all nodes in the network have a copy of the transaction**. Nodes can filter the messages they propagate, but the default is to propagate all valid transaction messages they receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Within just a few seconds, an Ethereum transaction propagates to all the Ethereum nodes around the globe. From the perspective of each node, it is not possible to discern the origin of the transaction. The neighbor that sent it to our node may be the originator of the transaction or may have received it from one of its neighbors**. To be able to track the origin of transactions, or interfere with propagation, an attacker would have to control a significant percentage of all nodes. This is part of the security and privacy design of P2P networks, especially as applied to blockchain networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recording on the blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "While all the nodes in Ethereum are equal peers, some of them are operated by miners and are feeding transactions and blocks to mining farms, which are computers with high-performance Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). **The mining computers add transactions to a candidate block and attempt to find a Proof-of-Work that makes the candidate block valid**. We will discuss this in more detail in Consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going into too much detail, valid transactions will eventually be included in a block of transactions and, thus, recorded in the Ethereum blockchain. **Once mined into a block, transactions also modify the state of the Ethereum singleton, either by modifying the balance of an account (in the case of a simple payment), or by invoking contracts that change their internal state. These changes are recorded alongside the transaction, in the form of a transaction receipt, which may also include events**. We will examine all this in much more detail in EVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our transaction has completed its journey from creation to signing by an EOA, propagation, and finally mining. It has changed the state of the singleton and left an indelible mark on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple signatures (multisig) transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities, you know that it is possible to create a Bitcoin multisig account which can only spend funds when multiple parties sign the transaction (e.g. 2 of 2 or 3 of 4 signatures). **Ethereum’s basic EOA value transactions have no provisions for multiple signatures, however arbitrary signing restrictions can be enforced by smart contracts with any conditions you can think of to handle the transfer of ether and tokens alike. This is one of the main advantages of the Ethereum protocol: <u> fully programmable money</u>.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To take advantage of this capability, ether has to be transferred to a \"wallet contract\" that is programmed with the spending rules desired, such as multi-signature requirements or spending limits (or combinations of the two). The wallet contract then officially sends the funds when prompted by an authorized EOA once the spending conditions have been satisfied.** For example, to protect your ether under a multisig condition, transfer the ether to a multisig contract. Whenever you want to send funds to another account, all the required users will need to send transactions to the contract using a regular wallet app, effectively authorizing the contract to perform the final transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These contracts can also be designed to require multiple signatures before executing local code or to trigger other contracts. **The security of the scheme is ultimately determined by the multisig contract code.**\n",

In contrast to that, **contract accounts are controlled by their program code (also commonly referred to as smart contracts) that is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**.\n",

Since then, the concept of smart contracts has evolved, especially after the introduction of decentralized blockchain platforms with the invention of Bitcoin in 2009. \n",

    "In this notebook, **we use the term “smart contract” to refer to immutable computer programs that run deterministically in the context of an Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Ethereum network protocol, i.e. on the decentralized Ethereum world computer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s unpack that definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computer programs**: Smart contracts are simply computer programs. The word contract has no legal meaning in this context.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable**: Once deployed, the code of a smart contract cannot change. Unlike traditional software, the only way to modify a smart contract is to deploy a new instance.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic**: The outcome of the execution of a smart contract is the same for everyone who runs it, given the context of the transaction that initiated its execution and the state of the Ethereum blockchain at the moment of execution.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The EVM context**: Smart contracts operate with a very limited execution context. They can access their own state, the context of the transaction that called them and some information about the most recent blocks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decentralized world computer**: The EVM runs as a local instance on every Ethereum node, but because all instances of the EVM operate on the same initial state and produce the same final state, the system as a whole operates as a single \"world computer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lifecycle of a smart contract\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smart contracts are typically written in a high-level language, such as Solidity. But in order to run, they must be compiled to the low-level bytecode that runs in the EVM. Once compiled, they are deployed on the Ethereum platform using a special contract creation transaction which is identified as such by being sent to the special contract creation address, namely 0x0.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Each contract is identified by an Ethereum address, which is derived from the contract creation transaction as a function of the originating account and nonce.** The Ethereum address of a contract can be used in a transaction as the recipient, sending funds to the contract or calling one of the contract’s functions. **Note that, unlike EOAs, there are no keys associated with an account created for a new smart contract. As the contract creator, you don’t get any special privileges at the protocol level (although you can explicitly code them into the smart contract, of course)**. You certainly don’t receive the private key for the contract account - it does’t exist - we can say that <u>smart contract accounts own themselves</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, contracts only run if they are called by a transaction. **All smart contracts in Ethereum are executed, ultimately, because of a transaction initiated from an Externally Owned Account. A contract can call another contract that can call another contract, and so on, but the first contract in such a chain of execution will always have been called by a transaction from an EOA**. Contracts never run “on their own”, or “run in the background”. Contracts effectively lie “**dormant**” until a transaction triggers execution, either directly or indirectly as part of a chain of contract calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "> It is also worth noting that smart contracts are not executed \"in parallel\" in any sense - the **Ethereum world computer can be considered to be a single-threaded machine**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions are atomic**, regardless of how many contracts they call or what those contracts do when called. Transactions execute in their entirety, with any changes in the global state (contracts, accounts, etc.) recorded only if all execution terminates successfully. Successful termination means that the program executed without an error and reached the end of execution. **If execution fails due to an error, all of its effects (changes in state) are “rolled back” as if the transaction never ran. A failed transaction is still recorded as having been attempted, and the ether spent on gas for the execution is deducted from the originating account**, but it otherwise has no other effects on contract or account state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, it important to remember that a **contract’s code cannot be changed. However a contract can be “deleted”, removing the code and it’s internal state (storage) from its address, leaving a blank account**. Any transactions sent to that account address after the contract has been deleted do not result in any code execution, because there is no longer any code there to execute. **To delete a contract, you execute an EVM opcode called SELFDESTRUCT (previously called SUICIDE). That operation costs “negative gas”, a gas refund, thereby incentivizing the release of network client resources from the deletion of stored state. Deleting a contract in this way does not remove the transaction history (past) of the contract, since the blockchain itself is immutable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **It is also important to note that the SELFDESTRUCT capability will only be available if the contract author programmed the smart contract to have that functionality**. If the contract’s code does not have a SELFDESTRUCT opcode, or it is inaccessible, the smart contract can not be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Ethereum high-level languages\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EVM is an virtual machine that runs a special form of machine code called EVM bytecode, just like your computer’s CPU, which runs machine code such as x86_64**. We will examine the operation and language of the EVM in much more detail later. In this section we will look at how smart contracts are written to run on the EVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to program smart contracts directly in bytecode, EVM bytecode is rather unwieldy and very difficult for programmers to read and understand. **Instead, most Ethereum developers use a high-level language to write programs, and a compiler to convert them into bytecode.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While any high-level language could be adapted to write smart contracts, adapting an arbitrary language to be compilable to EVM bytecode is quite a cumbersome exercise and would in general lead to some amount of confusion. **Smart contracts operate in a highly constrained and minimalistic execution environment (the EVM), where almost all of the usual user interfaces, operating system interfaces and hardware interfaces are not there. In addition, a special set of EVM specific system variables and functions need to be available. As such, it is easier to build a smart-contract language from scratch, than it is to constrain a general-purpose language and make it suitable for writing smart contracts**. As a result, a number of special-purpose languages have emerged for programming smart contracts. Ethereum has several such languages, together with the compilers needed to produce EVM-executable bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, **programming languages can be classified into two broad programming paradigms: declarative and imperative, also known as “functional” and “procedural”, respectively**.\n",
    "- In **Declarative programming**, we write functions that express the logic of a program, but not its flow. Declarative programming is used to create programs where there are no side effects, meaning that there are no changes to state outside of a function. Declarative programming languages include, for example, Haskell, SQL and HTML. <br><br>\n",
    "- **Imperative programming**, by contrast, is where a programmer writes a set of procedures that combine the logic and flow of a program. Imperative programming languages include, for example, BASIC, C, C++, and Java. <br><br>\n",
    "- Some languages are “**hybrid**”, meaning that they encourage declarative programming but can also be used to express an imperative programming paradigm. Such hybrids include Lisp, Erlang, Prolog, JavaScript, and Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, **any imperative language can be used to write in a declarative paradigm, but it often results in inelegant code. By comparison, pure declarative languages cannot be used to write in an imperative paradigm.** In purely declarative languages, there are no “variables”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**While imperative programming is easier to write and read**, and is more commonly used by programmers, **it can be very difficult to write programs that execute exactly as expected**. The ability of any part of the program to change the state makes it difficult to reason about a program’s execution and introduces many opportunities for unintended side effects and bugs. **Declarative programming by comparison is harder to write, but avoids side effects, making it easier to understand how a program will behave**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief explanatory article: [Impreative vs Declarative Paradigm](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/imperative-versus-declarative-code-whats-the-difference-adc7dd6c8380)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smart contracts create a very high burden for programmers: bugs cost money. As a result, it is critically important to write smart contracts without unintended effects. To do that, you must be able to clearly reason about the expected behavior of the program. So, declarative languages play a much bigger role in smart contracts than they do in general purpose software. Nevertheless, as you will see below, the most prolific language for smart contracts (Solidity) is imperative.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently supported high-level programming languages for smart contracts include (ordered by approximate age):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLL**<br>\n",
    "A functional (declarative) programming language, with Lisp-like syntax. It was the first high-level language for Ethereum smart contracts (written by the co-author of this book, Gavin Wood), but it is rarely used today.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serpent**<br>\n",
    "A procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to Python. Can also be used to write functional (declarative) code, though it is not entirely free of side effects. Used sparsely. First created by Vitalik Buterin.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solidity**<br>\n",
    "A procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to JavaScript, C++ or Java. The most popular and most frequently used language for Ethereum smart contracts. Created by Gavin Wood (co-author of this book).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vyper**<br>\n",
    "A more recently developed language, similar to Serpent and again with Python-like syntax. Intended to get closer to a pure-functional Python-like language than Serpent, but not to replace Serpent. Created by Vitalik Buterin.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bamboo**<br>\n",
    "A newly developed language, influenced by Erlang with explicit state transitions and without iterative flows (loops). Intended to reduce side effects and increase auditability. Very new and yet to be widely adopted.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are many languages to choose from. However, **of all these Solidity is by far the most popular, to the point of being the de-facto high-level language of Ethereum and even other EVM-like blockchains**. We will spend most of our time using Solidity, but will also explore some of the examples in other high-level languages, to gain an understanding of their different philosophies.\n"
