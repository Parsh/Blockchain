    "## Introduction to Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is cryptography?**\n",
    "> **Cryptography** is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as **data confidentiality**, **data integrity**, **authentication**, and **non-repudiation** are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted persons from doing the same. The cryptography literature often uses the name Alice (\"A\") for the sender, Bob (\"B\") for the intended recipient, and Eve (\"eavesdropper\") for the adversary. \n",

    "- [History of Cryptography](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/origin_of_cryptography.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern Cryptography:**\n",
    ">Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; **cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions**, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist **information-theoretically secure** schemes that probably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the one-time pad—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on: [Modern Cryptography](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/modern_cryptography.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptology:**<br>\n",
    "The art of devising ciphers (i.e cryptography) and breaking them i.e., cryptanalysis) is collectively known as cryptology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptanalysis:**<br>\n",
    "Cryptanalysis is the study of analyzing information systems in order to study the hidden aspects of the systems. Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis includes the study of side-channel attacks that do not target weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves, but instead exploit weaknesses in their implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Cryptanalysis is the sister branch of Cryptography and they both co-exist. The cryptographic process results in the cipher text for transmission or storage. It involves the study of cryptographic mechanism with the intention to break them. Cryptanalysis is also used during the design of the new cryptographic techniques to test their security strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Services of Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of using cryptography is to provide the following **four fundamental information security services:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidentiality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidentiality is the fundamental security service provided by cryptography. It is a security service that keeps the information from an unauthorized person. It is sometimes referred to as privacy or secrecy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Confidentiality can be achieved through numerous means starting from physically securing to the use of mathematical algorithms for data encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Integrity**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is security service that deals with identifying any alteration to the data. The data may get modified by an unauthorized entity intentionally or accidentally. Integrity service confirms that whether data is intact or not since it was last created, transmitted, or stored by an authorized user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integrity cannot prevent the alteration of data, but provides a means for detecting whether data has been manipulated in an unauthorized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication**\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication provides the identification of the originator. It confirms to the receiver that the data received has been sent only by an identified and verified sender.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Authentication service has two variants:\n",
    "- Message authentication identifies the originator of the message without any regard router or system that has sent the message.\n",
    "- Entity authentication is assurance that data has been received from a specific entity, say a particular website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the originator, authentication may also provide assurance about other parameters related to data such as the date and time of creation/transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-repudiation**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a security service that ensures that an entity cannot refuse the ownership of a previous commitment or an action. It is an assurance that the original creator of the data cannot deny the creation or transmission of the said data to a recipient or third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-repudiation is a property that is most desirable in situations where there are chances of a dispute over the exchange of data. For example, once an order is placed electronically, a purchaser cannot deny the purchase order, if non-repudiation service was enabled in this transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cryptography Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic primitives are well-established, low-level cryptographic algorithms that are frequently used to build cryptographic protocols for computer security systems. Alternatively, cryptography primitives can be defined as the tools and techniques in Cryptography that can be selectively used to provide a set of desired security services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some cryptography primitives:\n",
    "- Encryption\n",
    "- Hash functions\n",
    "- Message Authentication codes (MAC)\n",
    "- Digital Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating cryptographic systems, designers use cryptographic primitives as their most basic building blocks. Because of this, cryptographic primitives are designed to do one very specific task in a highly reliable fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows the primitives that can achieve a particular security service on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/CryptoPrimitives.png \"Crypto Primitives and thier corresponding security service\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Cryptographic primitives are intricately related and they are often combined to achieve a set of desired security services from a cryptosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The three steps in cryptography:**\n",
    ">When we introduce/devise a new primitive these 3 steps have to be rigorously followed:\n",
    "1. **Precisely specify threat model:** Threat model basically is knowing the capabilities of the adversaries, i.e., what can an adversarial do to attack the primitive and what is his goal in forging the primitive. In order to show that the primitive or cryptographic protocol is secure we need to prove that an adversary with the following capabilities would not be able to break the primitive/protocol. More on [Threat Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4tk2pnOUos)\n",
    "2. **Propose a construction**\n",
    "3. **Prove that breaking construction under threat model will solve an underlying hard problem**: A basic example would be, it is easy to multiply to large prime to get a value N, but it's hard to recover the factors given the value N. So, if our prime works on that concept than if an adversary breaks our primitive/protocol than it would land a solution to solving that hard problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Note:** For production system usage, never ever use your own implementation of the primitive or any cryptographic algorithm (as aside from the implementation errors there could be many side channels which could potentially result in easy breaching of your implementation). It is always recommended to use a trusted library for applying ciphering to production level data/information. [Explanatory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Re5xlEjC8w)\n",

    ">**Randomized Algorithms:** are those which produce different outputs given the same input, i.e., even though the input to the randomized algorithm is the same, it will produce different output each time, as Random Algorithm have an implicit argument, say r, which is sampled anew, from it's give universe, every time the algorithm is run therefore making the outcome different.<br><br>\n",

    "A cryptosystem is an implementation of cryptographic techniques and their accompanying infrastructure to provide information security services. A cryptosystem is also referred to as a cipher system.\n",

    "### Components of a Cryptosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The various components of a basic cryptosystem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plaintext:** It is the data to be protected during transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encryption Algorithm:** It is a mathematical process that produces a ciphertext for any given plaintext and encryption key. It is a cryptographic algorithm that takes plaintext and an encryption key as input and produces a ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ciphertext:** It is the scrambled version of the plaintext produced by the encryption algorithm using a specific the encryption key. The ciphertext is not guarded. It flows on public channel. It can be intercepted or compromised by anyone who has access to the communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decryption Algorithm:** It is a mathematical process, that produces a unique plaintext for any given ciphertext and decryption key. It is a cryptographic algorithm that takes a ciphertext and a decryption key as input, and outputs a plaintext. The decryption algorithm essentially reverses the encryption algorithm and is thus closely related to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encryption Key:** It is a value that is known to the sender. The sender inputs the encryption key into the encryption algorithm along with the plaintext in order to compute the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decryption Key:** It is a value that is known to the receiver. The decryption key is related to the encryption key, but is not always identical to it. The receiver inputs the decryption key into the decryption algorithm along with the ciphertext in order to compute the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given cryptosystem, a collection of all possible decryption keys is called a **key space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interceptor (an attacker) is an unauthorized entity who attempts to determine the plaintext. He can see the ciphertext and may know the decryption algorithm. He, however, must never know the decryption key.\n",

    "\n",
    "The encryption process where **same keys are used for encrypting and decrypting** the information is known as Symmetric Key Encryption.

Hence, the shared key should be a pair of keys => $K_{shared}$ = {$K_{C>>S}$, $K_{S>>C}$} where prior is used to encrypt/decrypt the information from client to server and the latter from server to client.\n",

    "**Challenge of Symmetric Key Cryptosystem**<br>\n",
    "There are two restrictive challenges of employing symmetric key cryptography:\n",

    "One-time pad (OTP), also called Vernam-cipher or the perfect cipher, is a crypto algorithm where plaintext is combined with a random key (where the random key is a uniform random variable from a key space K, i.e., selection of any key from K has equal uniform/equal probability). It is the only existing mathematically unbreakable encryption and is a symmetric cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a one-time pre-shared key the same size as, or longer than, the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition. If the key is truly random, is at least as long as the plaintext, is never reused in whole or in part, and is kept completely secret, then the resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Perfect Secrecy:** Perfect secrecy is the notion that, given an encrypted message (or ciphertext) from a perfectly secure encryption system (or cipher), absolutely nothing will be revealed about the unencrypted message (or plaintext) by the ciphertext i.e. perfect secrecy could be defined as having an absolute immunity to Cipher text only attacks. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "How One Time Pad has perfect secrecy?\n",
    ">Shannon proved in 1949 that One Time Pad has perfect secrecy due to uniform probability distribution of all mssgs (of same length) that could have resulted in the cipher text c (that adversary might have hold to) with the key k (of same length). That means, given a cipher text c (generated using a key k of length n) the probability of all the possible message, of length n, to be encrypted to that c is uniform/equal. Hence, c is equally probable of being an encryption of $m_{1}$, $m_{2}$ ...$m_{xyz}$. While there exist only single key that maps m to c (given as k = m XOR c).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pitfalls:** \n",
    "- One Time Pad though have a perfect secrecy but it still is largely impractical to implement (because of the length of key being equal to that of the message, and if we even found a way to secretly transfer message-long key then it would be a better approach to use that transfer mechanism to secretly transfer the message at the first place).\n",
    "- Thought it is secure to Cipher Text only attacks, but it is vulnerable to other forms of attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad News:** Shannon who proved that the OTP has the perfect secrecy later proved a theorem that states: **\"To have perfect secrecy the key size must always be greater than or equal to the size of the message\"**. Hence, ciphers that use keys smaller in size than the messages don't have perfect secrecy. \n",
    "Why? Because if the size of key (say n) is smaller than the message size (m), then the universe of keys (all possible keys of length n) would not have enough unique keys for encrypting each message in the universe of message (containing all the messages of of length m). And therefore we will end up using keys multiple times (at least twice) which breaks the perfect secrecy (Attack 1).\n",

Based on the experiments we have 2 events $W_{0}$ and $W_{1}$ where $W_{0}$ represents an event where for Exp(0) adversary outputted $b^{'}$ as 1 (thinking, wrongly, that the ciphertext corresponds to $m_{1}$). Similarly, $W_{1}$ represents an event where for Exp(1) adversary outputted $b^{'}$ as 1 (rightly guessed). The advantage is defined such that if the probability of both the events $W_{0}$ and $W_{1}$ is similar or close to each other then advantage would be close to zero, which would mean that the adversary isn't able to distinguish that whether the ciphertext was of $m_{0}$ or $m_{1}$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Overview:\n",
    ">A block cipher is an encryption method that applies a **deterministic algorithm along with a symmetric key to encrypt a block of text**, rather than encrypting one bit at a time as in stream ciphers. For example, a common block cipher, AES, encrypts 128 bit blocks with a key of predetermined length: 128, 192, or 256 bits. **Block ciphers are pseudorandom permutation (PRP) families** that operate on the fixed size block of bits. <br>\n",
    "Note: PRPs are functions that cannot be differentiated from completely random permutations and thus, are considered reliable, until proven unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BlockCiphers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Block cipher **modes of operation have been developed to eliminate the chance of encrypting identical blocks of text the same way**, the ciphertext formed from the previous encrypted block is applied to the next block. A block of bits called an **initialization vector (IV)** is also used by modes of operation to ensure ciphertexts remain distinct even when the same plaintext message is encrypted a number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the various modes of operation for block ciphers include **CBC** (cipher block chaining), **CFB** (cipher feedback), **CTR** (counter), and **GCM** (Galois/Counter Mode), among others. Above is an example of CBC mode. Where an IV is crossed with the initial plaintext block and the encryption algorithm is completed with a given key and the ciphertext is then outputted. This resultant cipher text is then used in place of the IV in subsequent plaintext blocks.\n",

    "**Working of Block Ciphers (Generic):**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BlockCipher-Working.png)\n",
    "Description: \n",
    "1. key is expanded into n number of keys called round keys (where n is the number of rounds which is subjective to individual block cipher).\n",
    "2. Cipher uses these round keys by iteratively encrypting the message again and again and again using what's referred to as the round function.\n",
    "3. Round function takes 2 inputs: Current state of the message and a round key (corresponding to that round). \n",
    "4. The output of one round function acts as the new state of the original message which is fed into the next round function. The output from the $n^{th}$ round function is the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Block ciphers are relatively slower than the stream cipher (and slower by large magnitude to eStream ciphers) but we will see that we can do many things with block ciphers that we couldn't do very efficiently with stream ciphers.\n",
