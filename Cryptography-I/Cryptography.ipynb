    "## Introduction to Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is cryptography?**\n",
    "> **Cryptography** is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as **data confidentiality**, **data integrity**, **authentication**, and **non-repudiation** are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted persons from doing the same. The cryptography literature often uses the name Alice (\"A\") for the sender, Bob (\"B\") for the intended recipient, and Eve (\"eavesdropper\") for the adversary. \n",

    "- [History of Cryptography](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/origin_of_cryptography.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern Cryptography:**\n",
    ">Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; **cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions**, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist **information-theoretically secure** schemes that probably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the one-time pad—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on: [Modern Cryptography](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/modern_cryptography.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptology:**<br>\n",
    "The art of devising ciphers (i.e cryptography) and breaking them i.e., cryptanalysis) is collectively known as cryptology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptanalysis:**<br>\n",
    "Cryptanalysis is the study of analyzing information systems in order to study the hidden aspects of the systems. Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis includes the study of side-channel attacks that do not target weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves, but instead exploit weaknesses in their implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Cryptanalysis is the sister branch of Cryptography and they both co-exist. The cryptographic process results in the cipher text for transmission or storage. It involves the study of cryptographic mechanism with the intention to break them. Cryptanalysis is also used during the design of the new cryptographic techniques to test their security strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Services of Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of using cryptography is to provide the following **four fundamental information security services:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidentiality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidentiality is the fundamental security service provided by cryptography. It is a security service that keeps the information from an unauthorized person. It is sometimes referred to as privacy or secrecy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Confidentiality can be achieved through numerous means starting from physically securing to the use of mathematical algorithms for data encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Integrity**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is security service that deals with identifying any alteration to the data. The data may get modified by an unauthorized entity intentionally or accidentally. Integrity service confirms that whether data is intact or not since it was last created, transmitted, or stored by an authorized user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integrity cannot prevent the alteration of data, but provides a means for detecting whether data has been manipulated in an unauthorized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication**\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication provides the identification of the originator. It confirms to the receiver that the data received has been sent only by an identified and verified sender.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Authentication service has two variants:\n",
    "- Message authentication identifies the originator of the message without any regard router or system that has sent the message.\n",
    "- Entity authentication is assurance that data has been received from a specific entity, say a particular website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the originator, authentication may also provide assurance about other parameters related to data such as the date and time of creation/transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-repudiation**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a security service that ensures that an entity cannot refuse the ownership of a previous commitment or an action. It is an assurance that the original creator of the data cannot deny the creation or transmission of the said data to a recipient or third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-repudiation is a property that is most desirable in situations where there are chances of a dispute over the exchange of data. For example, once an order is placed electronically, a purchaser cannot deny the purchase order, if non-repudiation service was enabled in this transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cryptography Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic primitives are well-established, low-level cryptographic algorithms that are frequently used to build cryptographic protocols for computer security systems. Alternatively, cryptography primitives can be defined as the tools and techniques in Cryptography that can be selectively used to provide a set of desired security services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some cryptography primitives:\n",
    "- Encryption\n",
    "- Hash functions\n",
    "- Message Authentication codes (MAC)\n",
    "- Digital Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating cryptographic systems, designers use cryptographic primitives as their most basic building blocks. Because of this, cryptographic primitives are designed to do one very specific task in a highly reliable fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows the primitives that can achieve a particular security service on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/CryptoPrimitives.png \"Crypto Primitives and thier corresponding security service\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Cryptographic primitives are intricately related and they are often combined to achieve a set of desired security services from a cryptosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The three steps in cryptography:**\n",
    ">When we introduce/devise a new primitive these 3 steps have to be rigorously followed:\n",
    "1. **Precisely specify threat model:** Threat model basically is knowing the capabilities of the adversaries, i.e., what can an adversarial do to attack the primitive and what is his goal in forging the primitive. In order to show that the primitive or cryptographic protocol is secure we need to prove that an adversary with the following capabilities would not be able to break the primitive/protocol. More on [Threat Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4tk2pnOUos)\n",
    "2. **Propose a construction**\n",
    "3. **Prove that breaking construction under threat model will solve an underlying hard problem**: A basic example would be, it is easy to multiply to large prime to get a value N, but it's hard to recover the factors given the value N. So, if our prime works on that concept than if an adversary breaks our primitive/protocol than it would land a solution to solving that hard problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Note:** For production system usage, never ever use your own implementation of the primitive or any cryptographic algorithm (as aside from the implementation errors there could be many side channels which could potentially result in easy breaching of your implementation). It is always recommended to use a trusted library for applying ciphering to production level data/information. [Explanatory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Re5xlEjC8w)\n",

    "Why Discrete Probability?\n",

    ">**Randomized Algorithms:** are those which produce different outputs given the same input, i.e., even though the input to the randomized algorithm is the same, it will produce different output each time, as Random Algorithm have an implicit argument, say r, which is sampled anew, from it's give universe, every time the algorithm is run therefore making the outcome different.<br><br>\n",

    "## Cryptosystems\n",
    "\n",
    "A cryptosystem is an implementation of cryptographic techniques and their accompanying infrastructure to provide information security services. A cryptosystem is also referred to as a cipher system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a Cryptosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The various components of a basic cryptosystem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plaintext:** It is the data to be protected during transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encryption Algorithm:** It is a mathematical process that produces a ciphertext for any given plaintext and encryption key. It is a cryptographic algorithm that takes plaintext and an encryption key as input and produces a ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ciphertext:** It is the scrambled version of the plaintext produced by the encryption algorithm using a specific the encryption key. The ciphertext is not guarded. It flows on public channel. It can be intercepted or compromised by anyone who has access to the communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decryption Algorithm:** It is a mathematical process, that produces a unique plaintext for any given ciphertext and decryption key. It is a cryptographic algorithm that takes a ciphertext and a decryption key as input, and outputs a plaintext. The decryption algorithm essentially reverses the encryption algorithm and is thus closely related to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encryption Key:** It is a value that is known to the sender. The sender inputs the encryption key into the encryption algorithm along with the plaintext in order to compute the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decryption Key:** It is a value that is known to the receiver. The decryption key is related to the encryption key, but is not always identical to it. The receiver inputs the decryption key into the decryption algorithm along with the ciphertext in order to compute the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given cryptosystem, a collection of all possible decryption keys is called a **key space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interceptor (an attacker) is an unauthorized entity who attempts to determine the plaintext. He can see the ciphertext and may know the decryption algorithm. He, however, must never know the decryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cryptosystems\n",
    "Fundamentally, there are two types of cryptosystems based on the manner in which encryption-decryption is carried out in the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Symmetric Key Cryptosystems\n",
    "- Asymmetric Key Cryptosystems\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between these cryptosystems is the relationship between the encryption and the decryption key. Logically, in any cryptosystem, both the keys are closely associated. It is practically impossible to decrypt the ciphertext with the key that is unrelated to the encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cryptographic Attacks\n",
    "The basic intention of an attacker is to break a cryptosystem and to find the plaintext from the ciphertext. To obtain the plaintext, the attacker only needs to find out the secret decryption key, as the algorithm is already in public domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, he applies maximum effort towards finding out the secret key used in the cryptosystem. Once the attacker is able to determine the key, the attacked system is considered as broken or compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the methodology used, attacks on cryptosystems are categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ciphertext Only Attacks (COA):** In this method, the attacker has access to a set of ciphertext(s). He does not have access to corresponding plaintext. COA is said to be successful when the corresponding plaintext can be determined from a given set of ciphertext. Occasionally, the encryption key can be determined from this attack. Modern cryptosystems are guarded against ciphertext-only attacks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Known Plaintext Attack (KPA):** In this method, the attacker knows the plaintext for some parts of the ciphertext. The task is to decrypt the rest of the ciphertext using this information. This may be done by determining the key or via some other method. The best example of this attack is linear cryptanalysis against block ciphers.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA):** In this method, the attacker has the text of his choice encrypted. So he has the ciphertext-plaintext pair of his choice. This simplifies his task of determining the encryption key. An example of this attack is differential cryptanalysis applied against block ciphers as well as hash functions. A popular public key cryptosystem, RSA is also vulnerable to chosen-plaintext attacks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary Attack:** This attack has many variants, all of which involve compiling a ‘dictionary’. In simplest method of this attack, attacker builds a dictionary of ciphertexts and corresponding plaintexts that he has learnt over a period of time. In future, when an attacker gets the ciphertext, he refers the dictionary to find the corresponding plaintext.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brute Force Attack/Extensive Search:** In this method, the attacker tries to determine the key by attempting all possible keys. If the key is 8 bits long, then the number of possible keys is 28 = 256. The attacker knows the ciphertext and the algorithm, now he attempts all the 256 keys one by one for decryption. The time to complete the attack would be very high if the key is long.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Birthday Attack:** This attack is a variant of brute-force technique. It is used against the cryptographic hash function. When students in a class are asked about their birthdays, the answer is one of the possible 365 dates. Let us assume the first student's birthdate is 3rd Aug. Then to find the next student whose birthdate is 3rd Aug, we need to enquire 1.25*√365 ≈ 25 students. <br><br> Similarly, if the hash function produces 64 bit hash values, the possible hash values are 1.8x10^19. By repeatedly evaluating the function for different inputs, the same output is expected to be obtained after about 5.1x10^9 random inputs. If the attacker is able to find two different inputs that give the same hash value, it is a collision and that hash function is said to be broken.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Man in Middle Attack (MIM):**  The targets of this attack are mostly public key cryptosystems where key exchange is involved before communication takes place.\n",
    "    - Host A wants to communicate to host B, hence requests public key of B.\n",
    "    - An attacker intercepts this request and sends his public key instead.\n",
    "    - Thus, whatever host A sends to host B, the attacker is able to read.\n",
    "    - In order to maintain communication, the attacker re-encrypts the data after reading with his public key and sends to B.\n",
    "    - The attacker sends his public key as A’s public key so that B takes it as if it is taking it from A.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Side Channel Attack (SCA):** This type of attack is not against any particular type of cryptosystem or algorithm. Instead, it is launched to exploit the weakness in physical implementation of the cryptosystem.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timing Attacks:** They exploit the fact that different computations take different times to compute on processor. By measuring such timings, it is be possible to know about a particular computation the processor is carrying out. For example, if the encryption takes a longer time, it indicates that the secret key is long.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Power Analysis Attacks:** These attacks are similar to timing attacks except that the amount of power consumption is used to obtain information about the nature of the underlying computations.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fault analysis Attacks:** In these attacks, errors are induced in the cryptosystem and the attacker studies the resulting output for useful information.\n",

    "The encryption process where **same keys are used for encrypting and decrypting** the information is known as Symmetric Key Encryption.

Hence, the shared key should be a pair of keys => $K_{shared}$ = {$K_{C>>S}$, $K_{S>>C}$} where prior is used to encrypt/decrypt the information from client to server and the latter from server to client.\n",

    "The **salient features of cryptosystem based on symmetric key encryption** are:\n",
    "- Persons using symmetric key encryption must share a common key prior to exchange of information.\n",

    "Go through the One Time Pad section in: Blockchain/CryptographyI/LectureSlides/Week1/StreamCiphers.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "One-time pad (OTP), also called Vernam-cipher or the perfect cipher, is a crypto algorithm where plaintext is combined with a random key (where the random key is a uniform random variable from a key space K, i.e., selection of any key from K has equal uniform/equal probability). It is the only existing mathematically unbreakable encryption and is a symmetric cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a one-time pre-shared key the same size as, or longer than, the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition. If the key is truly random, is at least as long as the plaintext, is never reused in whole or in part, and is kept completely secret, then the resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Even infinite computational power and infinite time cannot break one-time pad encryption, simply because it is mathematically impossible. However, if only one of these rules is disregarded, the cipher is no longer unbreakable.\n",
    "- The key is at least as long as the message or data that must be encrypted.\n",
    "- The key is truly random (not generated by a simple computer function or such)\n",
    "- Key and plaintext are calculated modulo 10 (digits), modulo 26 (letters) or modulo 2 (binary)\n",
    "- Each key is used only once (that's why we call it **One Time Pad**), and both sender and receiver must destroy their key after use. If the same key is used twice, the security will be compromised.\n",
    "- There should only be two copies of the key: one for the sender and one for the receiver (some exceptions exist for multiple receivers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perfect Secrecy:** Perfect secrecy is the notion that, given an encrypted message (or ciphertext) from a perfectly secure encryption system (or cipher), absolutely nothing will be revealed about the unencrypted message (or plaintext) by the ciphertext i.e. perfect secrecy could be defined as having an absolute immunity to Cipher text only attacks. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "How One Time Pad has perfect secrecy?\n",
    ">Shannon proved in 1949 that One Time Pad has perfect secrecy due to uniform probability distribution of all mssgs (of same length) that could have resulted in the cipher text c (that adversary might have hold to) with the key k (of same length). That means, given a cipher text c (generated using a key k of length n) the probability of all the possible message, of length n, to be encrypted to that c is uniform/equal. Hence, c is equally probable of being an encryption of $m_{1}$, $m_{2}$ ...$m_{xyz}$. While there exist only single key that maps m to c (given as k = m XOR c).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pitfalls:** \n",
    "- One Time Pad though have a perfect secrecy but it still is largely impractical to implement (because of the length of key being equal to that of the message, and if we even found a way to secretly transfer message-long key then it would be a better approach to use that transfer mechanism to secretly transfer the message at the first place).\n",
    "- Thought it is secure to Cipher Text only attacks, but it is vulnerable to other forms of attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad News:** Shannon who proved that the OTP has the perfect secrecy later proved a theorem that states: **\"To have perfect secrecy the key size must always be greater than or equal to the size of the message\"**. Hence, ciphers that use keys smaller in size than the messages don't have perfect secrecy. \n",
    "Why? Because if the size of key (say n) is smaller than the message size (m), then the universe of keys (all possible keys of length n) would not have enough unique keys for encrypting each message in the universe of message (containing all the messages of of length m). And therefore we will end up using keys multiple times (at least twice) which breaks the perfect secrecy (Attack 1).\n",

    ">A block cipher is an encryption method that applies a **deterministic algorithm along with a symmetric key to encrypt a block of text**, rather than encrypting one bit at a time as in stream ciphers. For example, a common block cipher, AES, encrypts 128 bit blocks with a key of predetermined length: 128, 192, or 256 bits. **Block ciphers are pseudorandom permutation (PRP) families** that operate on the fixed size block of bits. <br>\n",

    "Block cipher **modes of operation have been developed to eliminate the chance of encrypting identical blocks of text the same way**, the ciphertext formed from the previous encrypted block is applied to the next block. A block of bits called an **initialization vector (IV)** is also used by modes of operation to ensure ciphertexts remain distinct even when the same plaintext message is encrypted a number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the various modes of operation for block ciphers include **CBC** (cipher block chaining), **CFB** (cipher feedback), **CTR** (counter), and **GCM** (Galois/Counter Mode), among others. Above is an example of CBC mode. Where an IV is crossed with the initial plaintext block and the encryption algorithm is completed with a given key and the ciphertext is then outputted. This resultant cipher text is then used in place of the IV in subsequent plaintext blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working of Block Ciphers (Generic):**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BlockCipher-Working.png)\n",
    "Description: \n",
    "1. key is expanded into n number of keys called round keys (where n is the number of rounds which is subjective to individual block cipher).\n",
    "2. Cipher uses these round keys by iteratively encrypting the message again and again and again using what's referred to as the round function.\n",
    "3. Round function takes 2 inputs: Current state of the message and a round key (corresponding to that round). \n",
    "4. The output of one round function acts as the new state of the original message which is fed into the next round function. The output from the $n^{th}$ round function is the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to specify a particular block cipher (built by iteration, like DES) one has to specify the key expansion mechanism and the round function. (Those are the two dynamic part of a block cipher).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Block ciphers are relatively slower than the stream cipher (and slower by large magnitude to eStream ciphers) but we will see that we can do many things with block ciphers that we couldn't do very efficiently with stream ciphers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Block Cipher aka Psuedo Random Permutation (PRP)**<br>\n",
    "PRP accurately captures what a block ciphers basically is. <br>\n",
    "How?\n",
    ">As per my perception: A block cipher with size of the key as K, used (to say XOR), dictates the size of the block of the message M. Hence limiting the size of message block from its true gigantic universe to a small key-size universe and while we operate the key onto the message block the resultant/output is another state of the message belonging from the key-size universe (i.e. with the help of key we mapped the current state of message from the key-sized message universe to another state in itself, in a one-to-one mapping fashion, therefore permuted).\n",

Therefore, ECB is terrible as it **breaks the semantic security** (the adversary will learn something about the plaintext from the given ciphertext) given that we have two identical plaintext blocks. Attacks like CPA (chosen plain text attacks) breaks ECB, hence,**ECB is not CPA secure**.\n",

    ">**Cipher block chaining (CBC)** is a mode of operation for a block cipher (one in which a sequence of bits are encrypted as a single unit or block with a cipher key applied to the entire block). Cipher block chaining uses what is known as an initialization vector (IV) of a certain length. One of its key characteristics is that it uses a chaining mechanism that causes the decryption of a block of ciphertext to depend on all the preceding ciphertext blocks. As a result, the entire validity of all preceding blocks is contained in the immediately previous ciphertext block. A single bit error in a ciphertext block affects the decryption of all subsequent blocks. Rearrangement of the order of the ciphertext blocks causes decryption to become corrupted. Basically, in cipher block chaining, each plaintext block is XORed (see XOR) with the immediately previous ciphertext block, and then encrypted.\n",

    "The Flow:<br>\n",
    "$E_{CBC}$ is the our AES encryption scheme using the CBC mode of operation. When it's asked to encrypt a message m, the first thing it's going to do is it's going to choose a random IV (Initialization) that's exactly one block of the block cipher. So IV is one cypher block. So in the case of AES the IV would be 16 bytes (128 bits). And then we're gonna run through the algorithm here: \n",
    "\n",
    "The IV basically that we chose is gonna be XORed to the first plain text block. And then the result is gonna be encrypted using the AES block cipher and output the first block of the ciphertext. And now comes the chaining part where we actually use the first block of the ciphertext to kind of mask the second block of the plaintext. So we XOR the two together and the encryption of that becomes the second ciphertext block. And so on, and so on, and so forth. So this is cIpher block chaining, you can see that each cipher block is chained and XORed into the next plaintext block, and the final ciphertext is going to be essentially the initial IV that we chose along with all the ciphertext blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization Vector:** IV stands for Initialization Vector. And we're going to be seeing that term used quite a bit, every time we need to pick something at random at the beginning of the encryption scheme typically we'll call that an IV for initialization vector. So you notice that the **ciphertext is a little bit longer than the plaintext** because we had to include this IV in the ciphertexts which basically captures the randomness that was used during encryption.\n",

    "![](./Images/CBC-CPA-Analysis.png)\n",
    "So let's take it more precisely, basically if we start with a PRP, in other words, our block cipher E, that is defined over a space X, then we are gonna to end up with a encryption algorithm $E_{CBC}$ that takes messages of length L and outputs ciphertexts of length L+1. And then suppose we have an adversary that makes q chosen plaintext queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can state the following security fact, that for every such adversary that's attacking $E_{CBC}$, to exist an adversary that's attacking the PRP, the block cipher, with the following relation between the two algorithms: the advantage of algorithm A against the encryption scheme is less than the advantage of algorithm B against the original PRP plus some noise term. So lets  interpret this theorem, so what this means is that essentially since E is a secure PRP $Adv_{PRP}$[B, E] is negligible, and our goal is to say that adversary A's advantage is also negligible. However, here we are prevented from saying that because we got this extra error term. This is often called an error term and to argue that CBC is secure we have to make sure that the error term is also negligible. Because if both of these terms on the right are negligible, there sum is negligible and therefore the advantage of A against $E_{CBC}$ would also be negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this says that in fact for $E_{CBC}$ to be secure it has better be the case that $q^{2}$.$l^{2}$ is much, much, much smaller than the value X, where L is simply the length of the messages that we're encrypting (so L could be like say a 1000, which means that we are encrypting messages that are at most 1000 AES blocks) and q is the number of ciphertexts that the adversary gets to see under the CPA attack, but in real life what q is, is basically the number of times that we have used the key K to encrypt messages.\n",
