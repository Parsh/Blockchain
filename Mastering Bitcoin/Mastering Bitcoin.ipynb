    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Bitcoin?\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem**. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. The bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin are entirely virtual. There are no physical coins or even digital coins per se. The coins are implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient. **Users of bitcoin own keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin network. With these keys they can sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner**. Keys are often stored in a digital wallet on each user’s computer or smartphone. **Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin**, putting the control entirely in the hands of each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can it be used for?<br>\n",
    "Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, including buy and sell goods, send money to people or organizations, or extend credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Bitcoins are created? [Overview]\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a distributed, peer-to-peer system. As such there is no \"central\" server or point of control.<br> **Bitcoin are created through a process called mining, which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions. Any participant in the bitcoin network (i.e., anyone using a device running the full bitcoin protocol stack) may operate as a miner, using their computer’s processing power to verify and record transactions**.<br> Every 10 minutes, on average, a bitcoin miner is able to validate the transactions of the past 10 minutes and is rewarded with brand new bitcoin. Essentially, bitcoin mining decentralizes the currency-issuance and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces the need for any central bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin protocol includes built-in algorithms that regulate the mining function across the network. The difficulty of the processing task that miners must perform is adjusted dynamically so that, on average, someone succeeds every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners (and how much processing) are competing at any moment. **The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoin are created every 4 years, and limits the total number of bitcoin that will be created to a fixed total just below 21 million coins.** The result is that the number of bitcoin in circulation closely follows an easily predictable curve that approaches 21 million by the year 2140. Due to bitcoin’s diminishing rate of issuance, over the long term, the bitcoin currency is deflationary. Furthermore, bitcoin cannot be inflated by \"printing\" new money above and beyond the expected issuance rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, bitcoin is also the name of the protocol, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed computing innovation. The bitcoin currency is really only the first application of this invention. Bitcoin represents the culmination of decades of research in cryptography and distributed systems and includes four key innovations brought together in a unique and powerful combination. Bitcoin consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bitcoin Protocol**: A decentralized peer-to-peer network <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blockchain**: A public transaction ledger <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consensus Rules**: A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proof-of-Work Algorithm**: A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is akin to the internet of money, a network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Currencies Before Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence of viable digital money is closely linked to developments in cryptography. This is not surprising when one considers the fundamental challenges involved with using bits to represent value that can be exchanged for goods and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three basic questions for anyone accepting digital money are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I trust that the money is authentic and not counterfeit?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I trust that the digital money can only be spent once (known as the “double-spend” problem)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I be sure that no one else can claim this money belongs to them and not me?**\n",
    "\n",
    "How Paper Money addresses these issues:<br>\n",
    "Issuers of paper money are constantly battling the counterfeiting problem by using increasingly sophisticated papers and printing technology. Physical money addresses the double-spend issue easily because the same paper note cannot be in two places at once. Of course, conventional money is also often stored and transmitted digitally. In these cases, the counterfeiting and double-spend issues are handled by clearing all electronic transactions through central authorities that have a global view of the currency in circulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "How Digital Money address them:<br>\n",
    "For digital money, which cannot take advantage of esoteric inks or holographic strips, **cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user’s claim to value. Specifically, cryptographic digital signatures enable a user to sign a digital asset or transaction proving the ownership of that asset**. With the appropriate architecture, digital signatures also can be used to address the double-spend issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The History of Digital Currencies\n",
    "\n",
    "When cryptography started becoming more broadly available and understood in the late 1980s, many researchers began trying to use cryptography to build digital currencies. These early digital currency projects issued digital money, usually backed by a national currency or precious metal such as gold. Although these earlier digital currencies worked, **they were centralized** and, as a result, were easy to attack by governments and hackers. **Early digital currencies used a central clearinghouse to settle all transactions at regular intervals, just like a traditional banking system**. Unfortunately, in most cases these nascent digital currencies were targeted by worried governments and eventually litigated out of existence. Some failed in spectacular crashes when the parent company liquidated abruptly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be robust against intervention by antagonists, whether legitimate governments or criminal elements, a decentralized digital currency was needed to avoid a single point of attack. **Bitcoin is such a system, decentralized by design, and free of any central authority or point of control that can be attacked or corrupted.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin was invented in 2008 with the publication of a paper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" written under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto (see [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)). Nakamoto combined several prior inventions such as b-money and HashCash to create a completely decentralized electronic cash system that does not rely on a central authority for currency issuance or settlement and validation of transactions.<br> **The key innovation was to use a distributed computation system (called a \"Proof-of-Work\" algorithm) to conduct a global \"election\" every 10 minutes, allowing the decentralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions. This elegantly solves the issue of double-spend where a single currency unit can be spent twice.** Previously, the double-spend problem was a weakness of digital currency and was addressed by clearing all transactions through a central clearinghouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin network started in 2009, based on a reference implementation published by Nakamoto and since revised by many other programmers. **The implementation of the Proof-of-Work algorithm (mining) that provides security and resilience for bitcoin has increased in power exponentially, and now exceeds the combined processing power of the world’s top supercomputers**. Bitcoin’s total market value has at times exceeded 135 billion US dollars, depending on the bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate. The largest transaction processed so far by the network was 400 million US dollars, transmitted instantly and processed for a fee of 1 US dollar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from the public in April 2011, leaving the responsibility of developing the code and network to a thriving group of volunteers. The identity of the person or people behind bitcoin is still unknown. However, neither Satoshi Nakamoto nor anyone else exerts individual control over the bitcoin system, which operates based on fully transparent mathematical principles, open source code, and consensus among participants. The invention itself is groundbreaking and has already spawned new science in the fields of distributed computing, economics, and econometrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Solution to a Distributed Computing Problem (Byzantine Generals' Problem)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention is also a practical and novel solution to a problem in distributed computing, known as the \"Byzantine Generals' Problem.\" Briefly, the problem consists of trying to agree on a course of action or the state of a system by exchanging information over an unreliable and potentially compromised network. **Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution, which uses the concept of Proof-of-Work to achieve consensus without a central trusted authority, represents a breakthrough in distributed computing and has wide applicability beyond currency**. It can be used to achieve consensus on decentralized networks to prove the fairness of elections, lotteries, asset registries, digital notarization, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is an innovation in the ancient technology of money. At its core, money simply facilitates the exchange of value between people. Therefore, in order to fully understand bitcoin and its uses, we’ll examine it from the perspective of people using it. Each of the people and their stories, as listed here, illustrates one or more specific use cases. We’ll be seeing them throughout the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **North American low-value retail**<br>\n",
    "Alice lives in Northern California’s Bay Area. She has heard about bitcoin from her techie friends and wants to start using it. We will follow her story as she learns about bitcoin, acquires some, and then spends some of her bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee at Bob’s Cafe in Palo Alto. This story will introduce us to the software, the exchanges, and basic transactions from the perspective of a retail consumer.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **North American high-value retail**<br>\n",
    "Carol is an art gallery owner in San Francisco. She sells expensive paintings for bitcoin. This story will introduce the risks of a \"51%\" consensus attack for retailers of high-value items.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Offshore contract services**<br>\n",
    "Bob, the cafe owner in Palo Alto, is building a new website. He has contracted with an Indian web developer, Gopesh, who lives in Bangalore, India. Gopesh has agreed to be paid in bitcoin. This story will examine the use of bitcoin for outsourcing, contract services, and international wire transfers.<br><br>\n",

    "- **Charitable donations**<br>\n",
    "Eugenia is the director of a children’s charity in the Philippines. Recently she has discovered bitcoin and wants to use it to reach a whole new group of foreign and domestic donors to fundraise for her charity. She’s also investigating ways to use bitcoin to distribute funds quickly to areas of need. This story will show the use of bitcoin for global fundraising across currencies and borders and the use of an open ledger for transparency in charitable organizations.<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Mining for bitcoin**<br>\n",
    "Jing is a computer engineering student in Shanghai. He has built a \"mining\" rig to mine for bitcoin using his engineering skills to supplement his income. This story will examine the \"industrial\" base of bitcoin: the specialized equipment used to secure the bitcoin network and issue new currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these stories is based on the real people and real industries currently using bitcoin to create new markets, new industries, and innovative solutions to global economic issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin is a protocol that can be accessed using a client application that speaks the protocol**. A **\"bitcoin wallet\"** is the most common user interface to the bitcoin system, just like a web browser is the most common user interface for the HTTP protocol. There are many implementations and brands of bitcoin wallets, just like there are many brands of web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer). And just like we all have our favorite browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Yay!) and our villains (Internet Explorer, Yuck!), bitcoin wallets vary in quality, performance, security, privacy, and reliability. There is also a reference implementation of the bitcoin protocol that includes a wallet, known as the \"Satoshi Client\" or \"Bitcoin Core,\" which is derived from the original implementation written by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing a Bitcoin Wallet**<br>\n",
    "Bitcoin wallets are one of the most actively developed applications in the bitcoin ecosystem. There is intense competition, and while a new wallet is probably being developed right now, several wallets from last year are no longer actively maintained. Many wallets focus on specific platforms or specific uses and some are more suitable for beginners while others are filled with features for advanced users. Choosing a wallet is highly subjective and depends on the use and user expertise. It is therefore impossible to recommend a specific brand or wallet. However, we can categorize bitcoin wallets according to their platform and function and provide some clarity about all the different types of wallets that exist. Better yet, moving keys or seeds between bitcoin wallets is relatively easy, so it is worth trying out several different wallets until you find one that fits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin wallets categorization according to the platforms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Desktop wallet**<br>\n",
    "A desktop wallet was the first type of bitcoin wallet created as a reference implementation and many users run desktop wallets for the features, autonomy, and control they offer. Running on general-use operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS has certain security disadvantages however, as these platforms are often insecure and poorly configured.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mobile wallet**<br>\n",
    "A mobile wallet is the most common type of bitcoin wallet. Running on smart-phone operating systems such as Apple iOS and Android, these wallets are often a great choice for new users. Many are designed for simplicity and ease-of-use, but there are also fully featured mobile wallets for power users.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Web wallet** (Not Recommended for large amounts)<br>\n",
    "Web wallets are accessed through a web browser and store the user’s wallet on a server owned by a third party. This is similar to webmail in that it relies entirely on a third-party server. Some of these services operate using client-side code running in the user’s browser, which keeps control of the bitcoin keys in the hands of the user. Most, however, present a compromise by taking control of the bitcoin keys from users in exchange for ease-of-use. It is inadvisable to store large amounts of bitcoin on third-party systems.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hardware wallet** (Most Secure) <br>\n",
    "Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained bitcoin wallet on special-purpose hardware. They are operated via USB with a desktop web browser or via near-field-communication (NFC) on a mobile device. By handling all bitcoin-related operations on the specialized hardware, these wallets are considered very secure and suitable for storing large amounts of bitcoin.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Paper wallet** <br>\n",
    "The keys controlling bitcoin can also be printed for long-term storage. These are known as paper wallets even though other materials (wood, metal, etc.) can be used. Paper wallets offer a low-tech but highly secure means of storing bitcoin long term. Offline storage is also often referred to as cold storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin wallets categorization by their degree of autonomy and how they interact with the bitcoin network:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full-node client**<br>\n",
    "A full client, or \"full node,\" is a client that stores the entire history of bitcoin transactions (every transaction by every user, ever), manages users' wallets, and can initiate transactions directly on the bitcoin network. A full node handles all aspects of the protocol and can independently validate the entire blockchain and any transaction. A full-node client consumes substantial computer resources (e.g., more than 125 GB of disk, 2 GB of RAM) but offers complete autonomy and independent transaction verification.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lightweight client**<br>\n",
    "A lightweight client, also known as a **simple-payment-verification (SPV) client**, connects to bitcoin full nodes (mentioned previously) for access to the bitcoin transaction information, but stores the user wallet locally and independently creates, validates, and transmits transactions. Lightweight clients interact directly with the bitcoin network, without an intermediary.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third-party API client**<br>\n",
    "A third-party API client is one that interacts with bitcoin through a third-party system of application programming interfaces (APIs), rather than by connecting to the bitcoin network directly. The wallet may be stored by the user or by third-party servers, but all transactions go through a third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these categorizations, many bitcoin wallets fall into a few groups, with the three most common being desktop full client, mobile lightweight wallet, and web third-party wallet. The lines between different categories are often blurry, as many wallets run on multiple platforms and can interact with the network in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Start:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice, who we introduced in [Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories), is not a technical user and only recently heard about bitcoin from her friend Joe. While at a party, Joe is once again enthusiastically explaining bitcoin to all around him and is offering a demonstration. Intrigued, Alice asks how she can get started with bitcoin. Joe says that a mobile wallet is best for new users and he recommends a few of his favorite wallets. Alice downloads \"Mycelium\" for Android and installs it on her phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Alice runs Mycelium for the first time, as with many bitcoin wallets, the application automatically creates a new wallet for her. Alice sees the wallet on her screen, as shown in The Mycelium Mobile Wallet (note: do not send bitcoin to this sample address, it will be lost forever).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Mycelium.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of this screen is Alice’s **bitcoin address**. On the screen it appears as a long string of letters and numbers: 1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK. Next to the wallet’s bitcoin address is a QR code, a form of barcode that contains the same information in a format that can be scanned by a smartphone camera. The QR code is the square with a pattern of black and white dots. Alice can copy the bitcoin address or the QR code onto her clipboard by tapping the QR code, or the Receive button. In most wallets, tapping the QR code will also magnify it, so that it can be more easily scanned by a smartphone camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Bitcoin addresses start with a 1(P2PKH) or 3(P2SH)**. Like email addresses, they can be shared with other bitcoin users who can use them to send bitcoin directly to your wallet. There is nothing sensitive, from a security perspective, about the bitcoin address. It can be posted anywhere without risking the security of the account. Unlike email addresses, you can create new addresses as often as you like, all of which will direct funds to your wallet. **In fact, many modern wallets automatically create a new address for every transaction to maximize privacy. A wallet is simply a collection of addresses and the keys that unlock the funds within**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is now ready to receive funds. Her wallet application randomly generated a private key together with its corresponding bitcoin address. At this point, **her bitcoin address is not known to the bitcoin network or \"registered\" with any part of the bitcoin system. Her bitcoin address is simply a number that corresponds to a key that she can use to control access to the funds. It was generated independently by her wallet without reference or registration with any service**. In fact, in most wallets, there is no association between the bitcoin address and any externally identifiable information including the user’s identity. Until the moment this address is referenced as the recipient of value in a transaction posted on the bitcoin ledger, the bitcoin address is simply part of the vast number of possible addresses that are valid in bitcoin. **Only once a bitcoin address has been associated with a transaction does it become part of the known addresses in the network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is now ready to start using her new bitcoin wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Your First Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and often most difficult task for new users is to acquire some bitcoin. Unlike other foreign currencies, you cannot yet buy bitcoin at a bank or foreign exchange kiosk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Most electronic payment networks such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and bank account transfers are reversible. For someone selling bitcoin, this difference introduces a very high risk that the buyer will reverse the electronic payment after they have received bitcoin, in effect defrauding the seller**. To mitigate this risk, companies accepting traditional electronic payments in return for bitcoin usually require buyers to undergo identity verification and credit-worthiness checks, which may take several days or weeks. As a new user, this means you cannot buy bitcoin instantly with a credit card. With a bit of patience and creative thinking, however, you won’t need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some methods for getting bitcoin as a new user:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find a friend who has bitcoin and buy some from him or her directly. Many bitcoin users start this way. This method is the least complicated. One way to meet people with bitcoin is to attend a local bitcoin meetup listed at [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/topics/bitcoin/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a classified service such as [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/) to find a seller in your area to buy bitcoin for cash in an in-person transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Earn bitcoin by selling a product or service for bitcoin. If you are a programmer, sell your programming skills. If you’re a hairdresser, cut hair for bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a bitcoin ATM in your city. A bitcoin ATM is a machine that accepts cash and sends bitcoin to your smartphone bitcoin wallet. Find a bitcoin ATM close to you using an online map from [Coin ATM Radar](http://coinatmradar.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a bitcoin currency exchange linked to your bank account. Many countries now have currency exchanges that offer a market for buyers and sellers to swap bitcoin with local currency. Exchange-rate listing services, such as [BitcoinAverage](https://bitcoinaverage.com/), often show a list of bitcoin exchanges for each currency.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**One of the advantages of bitcoin over other payment systems is that, when used correctly, it affords users much more privacy. Acquiring, holding, and spending bitcoin does not require you to divulge sensitive and personally identifiable information to third parties**. However, where bitcoin touches traditional systems, such as currency exchanges, national and international regulations often apply. In order to exchange bitcoin for your national currency, you will often be required to provide proof of identity and banking information. **Users should be aware that once a bitcoin address is attached to an identity, all associated bitcoin transactions are also easy to identify and track**. This is one reason many users choose to maintain dedicated exchange accounts unlinked to their wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was introduced to bitcoin by a friend so she has an easy way to acquire her first bitcoin. Next, we will look at how she buys bitcoin from her friend Joe and how Joe sends the bitcoin to her wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Current Price of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Alice can buy bitcoin from Joe, they have to agree on the exchange rate between bitcoin and US dollars. This brings up a common question for those new to bitcoin: **\"Who sets the bitcoin price?\" The short answer is that the price is set by markets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin, like most other currencies, has a floating exchange rate. **That means that the value of bitcoin vis-a-vis any other currency fluctuates according to supply and demand in the various markets where it is traded**. For example, the \"price\" of bitcoin in US dollars is calculated in each market based on the most recent trade of bitcoin and US dollars. As such, the price tends to fluctuate minutely several times per second. **A pricing service will aggregate the prices from several markets and calculate a volume-weighted average representing the broad market exchange rate of a currency pair (e.g., BTC/USD)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hundreds of applications and websites that can provide the current market rate. Here are some of the most popular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Bitcoin Average](https://bitcoinaverage.com/): A site that provides a simple view of the volume-weighted-average for each currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [CoinCap](http://coincap.io/): A service listing the market capitalization and exchange rates of hundreds of crypto-currencies, including bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin Reference Rate](http://bit.ly/cmebrr): A reference rate that can be used for institutional and contractual reference, provided as part of investment data feeds by the CME.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these various sites and applications, **most bitcoin wallets will automatically convert amounts between bitcoin and other currencies**. Joe will use his wallet to convert the price automatically before sending bitcoin to Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending and Receiving Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice has decided to exchange $\\$$10 US dollars for bitcoin, so as not to risk too much money on this new technology. She gives Joe $10 in cash, opens her Mycelium wallet application, and selects Receive. This displays a QR code with Alice’s first bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe then selects Send on his smartphone wallet and is presented with a screen containing two inputs:\n",
    "- A destination bitcoin address\n",
    "- The amount to send, in bitcoin (BTC) or his local currency (USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the input field for the bitcoin address, there is a small icon that looks like a QR code. This allows Joe to scan the barcode with his smartphone camera so that he doesn’t have to type in Alice’s bitcoin address, which is quite long and difficult to type. Joe taps the QR code icon and activates the smartphone camera, scanning the QR code displayed on Alice’s smartphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe now has Alice’s bitcoin address set as the recipient. Joe enters the amount as $\\$$10 US dollars and his wallet converts it by accessing the most recent exchange rate from an online service. The exchange rate at the time is $\\$$100 US dollars per bitcoin, so $\\$$10 US dollars is worth 0.10 bitcoin (BTC), or 100 millibitcoin (mBTC) as shown in the screenshot from Joe’s wallet (see Airbitz mobile bitcoin wallet send screen below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Airbitz.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe then carefully checks to make sure he has entered the correct amount, because he is about to transmit money and mistakes are irreversible. After double-checking the address and amount, he presses Send to transmit the transaction. Joe’s mobile bitcoin wallet constructs a transaction that assigns 0.10 BTC to the address provided by Alice, sourcing the funds from Joe’s wallet and signing the transaction with Joe’s private keys. This tells the bitcoin network that Joe has authorized a transfer of value to Alice’s new address. As the transaction is transmitted via the peer-to-peer protocol, it quickly propagates across the bitcoin network. In less than a second, most of the well-connected nodes in the network receive the transaction and see Alice’s address for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, Alice’s wallet is constantly \"listening\" to published transactions on the bitcoin network, looking for any that match the addresses in her wallets. A few seconds after Joe’s wallet transmits the transaction, Alice’s wallet will indicate that it is receiving 0.10 BTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confirmations\n",
    "At first, Alice’s address will show the transaction from Joe as \"Unconfirmed.\" This means that the transaction has been propagated to the network but has not yet been recorded in the bitcoin transaction ledger, known as the blockchain. **To be confirmed, a transaction must be included in a block and added to the blockchain, which happens every 10 minutes, on average.

    "## Transactions, Blocks, Mining, and the Blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin system, unlike traditional banking and payment systems, is based on decentralized trust. **Instead of a central trusted authority, in bitcoin, trust is achieved as an emergent property from the interactions of different participants in the bitcoin system**. In this section, we will examine bitcoin from a high level by tracking a single transaction through the bitcoin system and watch as it becomes \"trusted\" and accepted by the bitcoin mechanism of distributed consensus and is finally recorded on the blockchain, the distributed ledger of all transactions. Subsequent sections will delve into the technology behind transactions, the network, and mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bitcoin Overview\n",
    "In the overview diagram shown below, we see that the bitcoin system consists of users with wallets containing keys, transactions that are propagated across the network, and miners who produce (through competitive computation) the consensus blockchain, which is the authoritative ledger of all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BitcoinOverview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in this section is based on an actual transaction made on the bitcoin network, simulating the interactions between the users (Joe, Alice, Bob, and Gopesh) by sending funds from one wallet to another. While tracking a transaction through the bitcoin network to the blockchain, we will use a blockchain explorer site to visualize each step. **A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as a bitcoin search engine, in that it allows you to search for addresses, transactions, and blocks and see the relationships and flows between them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular blockchain explorers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BlockCypher Explorer](https://live.blockcypher.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [blockchain.info](https://www.blockchain.com/en/explorer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BitPay Insight](https://insight.bitpay.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these has a search function that can take a bitcoin address, transaction hash, block number, or block hash and retrieve corresponding information from the bitcoin network. With each transaction or block example, we will be having a URL so we can look it up and study it in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buying a Cup of Coffee\n",
    "Alice, introduced in the previous segment, is a new user who has just acquired her first bitcoin. In [Getting Your First Bitcoin](#Getting-Your-First-Bitcoin), Alice met with her friend Joe to exchange some cash for bitcoin. The transaction created by Joe funded Alice’s wallet with 0.10 BTC. Now Alice will make her first retail transaction, buying a cup of coffee at Bob’s coffee shop in Palo Alto, California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s Cafe recently started accepting bitcoin payments by adding a bitcoin option to its point-of-sale system. The prices at Bob’s Cafe are listed in the local currency (US dollars), but at the register, customers have the option of paying in either dollars or bitcoin. Alice places her order for a cup of coffee and Bob enters it into the register, as he does for all transactions. The point-of-sale system automatically converts the total price from US dollars to bitcoin at the prevailing market rate and displays the price in both currencies: Total: 1.50 USD / 0.015 BTC. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s point-of-sale system will also automatically create a special QR code containing a payment request referred to as **Payment Request QR Code**. Unlike a QR code that simply contains a destination bitcoin address, **a payment request is a QR-encoded URL that contains a destination address, a payment amount, and a generic description such as \"Bob’s Cafe\"**. This allows a bitcoin wallet application to prefill the information used to send the payment while showing a human-readable description to the user. You can scan the QR code with a bitcoin wallet application to see what Alice would see.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PaymentQREncodingURL.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice uses her smartphone to scan the barcode on display. Her smartphone shows a payment of 0.0150 BTC to Bob's Cafe and she selects Send to authorize the payment. Within a few seconds (about the same amount of time as a credit card authorization), Bob sees the transaction on the register, completing the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can examine Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe on the blockchain using a block explorer site ([View Alice’s transaction on blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/tx/0627052b6f28912f2703066a912ea577f2ce4da4caa5a5fbd8a57286c345c2f2))\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will examine this transaction in more detail. We’ll see how Alice’s wallet constructed it, how it was propagated across the network, how it was verified, and finally, how Bob can spend that amount in subsequent transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The bitcoin network can transact in fractional values, e.g., from millibitcoin (1/1000th of a bitcoin) down to 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin, which is known as a satoshi. Throughout this notebook, we’ll use the term “bitcoin” to refer to any quantity of bitcoin currency, from the smallest unit (1 satoshi) to the total number (21,000,000) of all bitcoin that will ever be mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, **a transaction tells the network that the owner of some bitcoin value has authorized the transfer of that value to another owner**. The new owner can now spend the bitcoin by creating another transaction that authorizes the transfer to another owner, and so on, in a chain of ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions are like lines in a double-entry bookkeeping ledger**. Each transaction contains one or more \"inputs,\" which are like debits against a bitcoin account. On the other side of the transaction, there are one or more \"outputs,\" which are like credits added to a bitcoin account. **The inputs and outputs (debits and credits) do not necessarily add up to the same amount. Instead, outputs add up to slightly less than inputs and the difference represents an implied transaction fee, which is a small payment collected by the miner who includes the transaction in the ledger**. A bitcoin transaction is shown as a bookkeeping ledger entry below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransacsAsDouble-Entry.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The transaction also contains proof of ownership for each amount of bitcoin (inputs) whose value is being spent, in the form of a digital signature from the owner, which can be independently validated by anyone.** In bitcoin terms, \"spending\" is signing a transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction over to a new owner identified by a bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s payment to Bob’s Cafe uses a previous transaction’s output as its input. In the previous section, Alice received bitcoin from her friend Joe in return for cash. That transaction created a bitcoin value locked by Alice’s key. Her new transaction to Bob’s Cafe references the previous transaction as an input and creates new outputs to pay for the cup of coffee and receive change. **The transactions form a chain, where the inputs from the latest transaction correspond to outputs from previous transactions. Alice’s key provides the signature that unlocks those previous transaction outputs, thereby proving to the bitcoin network that she owns the funds**. She attaches the payment for coffee to Bob’s address, thereby \"encumbering\" that output with the requirement that Bob produces a signature in order to spend that amount. This represents a transfer of value between Alice and Bob. This chain of transactions, from Joe to Alice to Bob, is illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransactionChain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Many bitcoin transactions will include outputs that reference both an address of the new owner and an address of the current owner, called the change address. This is because transaction inputs, like currency notes, cannot be divided. If you purchase a $\\$$5 US dollar item in a store but use a $\\$$ 20 US dollar bill to pay for the item, you expect to receive $\\$$15 US dollars in change. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to bitcoin transaction inputs. **If you purchased an item that costs 5 bitcoin but only had a 20 bitcoin input to use, you would send one output of 5 bitcoin to the store owner and one output of 15 bitcoin back to yourself as change (minus any applicable transaction fee)**. Importantly, the change address does not have to be the same address as that of the input and for privacy reasons is often a new address from the owner’s wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different wallets may use different strategies when aggregating inputs to make a payment requested by the user. They might aggregate many small inputs, or use one that is equal to or larger than the desired payment. **Unless the wallet can aggregate inputs in such a way to exactly match the desired payment plus transaction fees, the wallet will need to generate some change**. This is very similar to how people handle cash. If you always use the largest bill/note in your pocket, you will end up with a pocket full of loose change. If you only use the loose change, you’ll always have only big bills. People subconsciously find a balance between these two extremes, and bitcoin wallet developers strive to program this balance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In summary, **transactions move value from transaction inputs to transaction outputs**. An input is a reference to a previous transaction’s output, showing where the value is coming from. A transaction output directs a specific value to a new owner’s bitcoin address and can include a change output back to the original owner. Outputs from one transaction can be used as inputs in a new transaction, thus creating a chain of ownership as the value is moved from owner to owner\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Transaction Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "From 1: Common Transaction:<br>The most common form of transaction is a simple payment from one address to another, which often includes some \"change\" returned to the original owner. This type of transaction has one input and two outputs as shown below:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/CommonTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "From 2: Aggregating Transaction:<br>Another common form of transaction is one that aggregates several inputs into a single output. This represents the real-world equivalent of using a pile of coins and currency notes for paying a large value. Transactions like these are sometimes generated by wallet applications to clean up lots of smaller amounts that were received as change for payments.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AggregatingTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "From 3: Distributing Transaction:<br>\n",
    "Finally, another transaction form that is seen often on the bitcoin ledger is a transaction that distributes one input to multiple outputs representing multiple recipients. This type of transaction is sometimes used by commercial entities to distribute funds, such as when processing payroll payments to multiple employees.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/DistributingTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing a Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alice’s wallet application contains all the logic for selecting appropriate inputs and outputs to build a transaction to Alice’s specification. Alice only needs to specify a destination and an amount, and the rest happens in the wallet application without her seeing the details**. Importantly, a wallet application can construct transactions even if it is completely offline. Like writing a check at home and later sending it to the bank in an envelope, the transaction does not need to be constructed and signed while connected to the bitcoin network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Right Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alice’s wallet application will first have to find inputs that can pay the amount she wants to send to Bob. Most wallets keep track of all the available outputs belonging to addresses in the walle**t. Therefore, Alice’s wallet would contain a copy of the transaction output from Joe’s transaction, which was created in exchange for cash. A bitcoin wallet application that runs as a full-node client actually contains a copy of every unspent output from every transaction in the blockchain. This allows a wallet to construct transaction inputs as well as quickly verify incoming transactions as having correct inputs. However, **because a full-node client takes up a lot of disk space, most user wallets run \"lightweight\" clients that track only the user’s own unspent outputs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the wallet application does not maintain a copy of unspent transaction outputs, it can query the bitcoin network to retrieve this information using a variety of APIs available by different providers or by asking a full-node using an application programming interface (API) call**. The image below shows an API request, constructed as an HTTP GET command to a specific URL. This URL will return all the unspent transaction outputs for an address, giving any application the information it needs to construct transaction inputs for spending. We use the simple command-line HTTP client cURL to retrieve the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/UnspentAPIRequest.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The response shows one unspent output (one that has not been redeemed yet) under the ownership of Alice’s address 1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK. The response includes the reference to the transaction in which this unspent output is contained (the payment from Joe) and its value in satoshis, at 10 million, equivalent to 0.10 bitcoin. With this information, Alice’s wallet application can construct a transaction to transfer that value to new owner addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Alice’s wallet contains enough bitcoin in a single unspent output to pay for the cup of coffee. Had this not been the case, Alice’s wallet application might have to search through a pile of smaller unspent outputs, like picking coins from a purse until it could find enough to pay for the coffee. In both cases, there might be a need to get some change back, which we'll see in the next section, as the wallet application creates the transaction outputs (payments).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction output is created in the form of a script that creates an encumbrance on the value and can only be redeemed by the introduction of a solution to the script. In simpler terms, **Alice’s transaction output will contain a script that says something like, \"This output is payable to whoever can present a signature from the key corresponding to Bob’s public address.\" Because only Bob has the wallet with the keys corresponding to that address, only Bob’s wallet can present such a signature to redeem this output**. Alice will therefore \"encumber\" the output value with a demand for a signature from Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transaction will also include a second output, because Alice’s funds are in the form of a 0.10 BTC output, too much money for the 0.015 BTC cup of coffee. Alice will need 0.085 BTC in change. Alice’s change payment is created by Alice’s wallet as an output in the very same transaction as the payment to Bob. Essentially, Alice’s wallet breaks her funds into two payments: one to Bob and one back to herself. She can then use (spend) the change output in a subsequent transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the transaction to be processed by the network in a timely fashion, Alice’s wallet application will add a small fee. This is not explicit in the transaction; it is implied by the difference between inputs and outputs. If instead of taking 0.085 in change, Alice creates only 0.0845 as the second output, there will be 0.0005 BTC (half a millibitcoin) left over. The input’s 0.10 BTC is not fully spent with the two outputs, because they will add up to less than 0.10. The resulting difference is the transaction fee that is collected by the miner as a fee for validating and including the transaction in a block to be recorded on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting transaction can be seen using a blockchain explorer web application, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AliceTransac2Bob.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the Transaction to the Ledger\n",
    "**The transaction created by Alice’s wallet application is 258 bytes long and contains everything necessary to confirm ownership of the funds and assign new owners**. Now, the transaction must be transmitted to the bitcoin network where it will become part of the blockchain. In the next section we will see how a transaction becomes part of a new block and how the block is \"mined.\" Finally, we will see how the new block, once added to the blockchain, is increasingly trusted by the network as more blocks are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transmitting the transaction\n",
    "Because the transaction contains all the information necessary to process, it does not matter how or where it is transmitted to the bitcoin network. The bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer network, with each bitcoin client participating by connecting to several other bitcoin clients. The purpose of the bitcoin network is to propagate transactions and blocks to all participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it propagates\n",
    "**Any system, such as a server, desktop application, or wallet, that participates in the bitcoin network by \"speaking\" the bitcoin protocol is called a bitcoin node**. Alice’s wallet application can send the new transaction to any bitcoin node it is connected to over any type of connection: wired, WiFi, mobile, etc. Her bitcoin wallet does not have to be connected to Bob’s bitcoin wallet directly and she does not have to use the internet connection offered by the cafe, though both those options are possible, too. **Any bitcoin node that receives a valid transaction it has not seen before will immediately forward it to all other nodes to which it is connected, a propagation technique known as flooding**. Thus, the transaction rapidly propagates out across the peer-to-peer network, reaching a large percentage of the nodes within a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bob’s view**\n",
    "\n",
    "If Bob’s bitcoin wallet application is directly connected to Alice’s wallet application, Bob’s wallet application might be the first node to receive the transaction. However, even if Alice’s wallet sends the transaction through other nodes, it will reach Bob’s wallet within a few seconds.<br> **Bob’s wallet will immediately identify Alice’s transaction as an incoming payment because it contains outputs redeemable by Bob’s keys. Bob’s wallet application can also independently verify that the transaction is well formed, uses previously unspent inputs, and contains sufficient transaction fees to be included in the next block**. At this point Bob can assume, with little risk, that the transaction will shortly be included in a block and confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A common misconception about bitcoin transactions is that they must be \"confirmed\" by waiting 10 minutes for a new block, or up to 60 minutes for a full six confirmations. Although confirmations ensure the transaction has been accepted by the whole network, such a delay is unnecessary for small-value items such as a cup of coffee. A merchant may accept a valid small-value transaction with no confirmations, with no more risk than a credit card payment made without an ID or a signature, as merchants routinely accept today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s transaction is now propagated on the bitcoin network. It does not become part of the blockchain until it is verified and included in a block by a process called mining. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The bitcoin system of trust is based on computation. Transactions are bundled into blocks, which require an enormous amount of computation to prove, but only a small amount of computation to verify as proven**. The mining process serves two purposes in bitcoin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mining nodes validate all transactions by reference to bitcoin’s consensus rules. Therefore, mining provides security for bitcoin transactions by rejecting invalid or malformed transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mining creates new bitcoin in each block, almost like a central bank printing new money. The amount of bitcoin created per block is limited and diminishes with time, following a fixed issuance schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mining achieves a fine balance between cost and reward. Mining uses electricity to solve a mathematical problem. A successful miner will collect a reward in the form of new bitcoin and transaction fees. However, the reward will only be collected if the miner has correctly validated all the transactions, to the satisfaction of the rules of consensus. This delicate balance provides security for bitcoin without a central authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mining: An Analogical Explanation**<br>\n",
    "A good way to describe mining is like a giant competitive game of sudoku that resets every time someone finds a solution and whose difficulty automatically adjusts so that it takes approximately 10 minutes to find a solution. Imagine a giant sudoku puzzle, several thousand rows and columns in size. If I show you a completed puzzle you can verify it quite quickly. However, if the puzzle has a few squares filled and the rest are empty, it takes a lot of work to solve! The difficulty of the sudoku can be adjusted by changing its size (more or fewer rows and columns), but it can still be verified quite easily even if it is very large. **The \"puzzle\" used in bitcoin is based on a cryptographic hash and exhibits similar characteristics: it is asymmetrically hard to solve but easy to verify, and its difficulty can be adjusted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories), we introduced Jing, an entrepreneur in Shanghai. Jing runs a mining farm, which is a business that runs thousands of specialized mining computers, competing for the reward. Every 10 minutes or so, Jing’s mining computers compete against thousands of similar systems in a global race to find a solution to a block of transactions. **Finding such a solution, the so-called Proof-of-Work (PoW), requires quadrillions of hashing operations per second across the entire bitcoin network. The algorithm for Proof-of-Work involves repeatedly hashing the header of the block and a random number with the SHA256 cryptographic algorithm until a solution matching a predetermined pattern emerges**. The first miner to find such a solution wins the round of competition and publishes that block into the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jing started mining in 2010 using a very fast desktop computer to find a suitable Proof-of-Work for new blocks. As more miners started joining the bitcoin network, the difficulty of the problem increased rapidly. Soon, Jing and other miners upgraded to more specialized hardware, such as high-end dedicated graphical processing units (GPUs) cards such as those used in gaming desktops or consoles. At the time of this writing, the difficulty is so high that it is profitable only to mine with application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), essentially hundreds of mining algorithms printed in hardware, running in parallel on a single silicon chip. Jing’s company also participates in a mining pool, which much like a lottery pool allows several participants to share their efforts and rewards. Jing’s company now runs a warehouse containing thousands of ASIC miners to mine for bitcoin 24 hours a day. The company pays its electricity costs by selling the bitcoin it is able to generate from mining, creating some income from the profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mining Transactions in Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "New transactions are constantly flowing into the network from user wallets and other applications. As these are seen by the bitcoin network nodes, they get added to a temporary pool of unverified transactions maintained by each node. **As miners construct a new block, they add unverified transactions from this pool to the new block and then attempt to prove the validity of that new block, with the mining algorithm (Proof-of-Work).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are added to the new block, prioritized by the highest-fee transactions first and a few other criteria. <br>**Each miner starts the process of mining a new block of transactions as soon as he receives the previous block from the network, knowing he has lost that previous round of competition. He immediately creates a new block, fills it with transactions and the fingerprint of the previous block, and starts calculating the Proof-of-Work for the new block. Each miner includes a special transaction in his block, one that pays his own bitcoin address the block reward (currently 12.5 newly created bitcoin) plus the sum of transaction fees from all the transactions included in the block. If he finds a solution that makes that block valid, he \"wins\" this reward because his successful block is added to the global blockchain and the reward transaction he included becomes spendable**.<br> Jing, who participates in a mining pool, has set up his software to create new blocks that assign the reward to a pool address. From there, a share of the reward is distributed to Jing and other miners in proportion to the amount of work they contributed in the last round.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s transaction was picked up by the network and included in the pool of unverified transactions. Once validated by the mining software it was included in a new block, called a candidate block, generated by Jing’s mining pool. All the miners participating in that mining pool immediately start computing Proof-of-Work for the candidate block. Approximately five minutes after the transaction was first transmitted by Alice’s wallet, one of Jing’s ASIC miners found a solution for the candidate block and announced it to the network. Once other miners validated the winning block they started the race to generate the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the block that includes [Alice's Transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/block-height/277316)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jing’s winning block became part of the blockchain as block #277316, containing 419 transactions, including Alice’s transaction. **The block containing Alice’s transaction is counted as one \"confirmation\" of that transaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 19 minutes later, a new block, #277317, is mined by another miner. Because this new block is built on top of block #277316 that contained Alice’s transaction, it added even more computation to the blockchain, thereby strengthening the trust in those transactions. **Each block mined on top of the one containing the transaction counts as an additional confirmation for Alice’s transaction. As the blocks pile on top of each other, it becomes exponentially harder to reverse the transaction, thereby making it more and more trusted by the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AlicesTransacInBlock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram we can see block #277316, which contains Alice’s transaction. Below it are 277,316 blocks (including block #0), linked to each other in a chain of blocks (blockchain) all the way back to block #0, known as the **genesis block**. Over time, **as the \"height\" in blocks increases, so does the computation difficulty for each block and the chain as a whole**. The blocks mined after the one that contains Alice’s transaction act as further assurance, as they pile on more computation in a longer and longer chain. **By convention, any block with more than six confirmations is considered irrevocable, because it would require an immense amount of computation to invalidate and recalculate six blocks**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pool Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooled mining is a mining approach where multiple generating clients contribute to the generation of a block, and then split the block reward according the contributed processing power. Pooled mining effectively reduces the granularity of the block generation reward, spreading it out more smoothly over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mining pool coordinates the workers. Think of it like a lottery. If you and your friends all buy tickets in the lottery the group has a better chance of winning i.e. **pool mining elevates the probability of successful generation of a block**. To be fair in the lottery example everyone should be rewarded proportional to the amount of money spent on tickets. So if there are 20 tickets for the pool one person purchased 10 and two people purchased 5 each - if one of the 20 tickets win the person who purchased 10 gets 50% and the other two get 25% each.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a mining pool does is function as a coordinator for all the pool participants doing:\n",
    "- Taking the pool members hashes\n",
    "- Looking for block rewards\n",
    "- Recording how much work all the participants are doing\n",
    "- Assigning block rewards proportionally to participants contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Miners mine differently by running pool software instead of the bitcoin client and just performing hashes for the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spending the Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that Alice’s transaction has been embedded in the blockchain as part of a block, it is part of the distributed ledger of bitcoin and visible to all bitcoin applications. Each bitcoin client can independently verify the transaction as valid and spendable.<br> **Full-node clients can track the source of the funds from the moment a given bitcoin(s) was first generated in a block, incrementally from transaction to transaction, until they reach Bob’s address. Lightweight clients can do what is called a simplified payment verification by confirming that the transaction is in the blockchain and has several blocks mined after it, thus providing assurance that the miners accepted it as valid**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob can now spend the output from this and other transactions. For example, Bob can pay a contractor or supplier by transferring value from Alice’s coffee cup payment to these new owners. Most likely, Bob’s bitcoin software will aggregate many small payments into a larger payment, perhaps concentrating all the day’s bitcoin revenue into a single transaction. This would aggregate the various payments into a single output (and a single address).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Bob spends the payments received from Alice and other customers, he extends the chain of transactions. Let’s assume that Bob pays his web designer Gopesh in Bangalore for a new website page. Now the chain of transactions will look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ABG-TransactionChain.png)\n",
    "Note: The Inputs and Outputs don't have the names of the entities participating in transactions, rather the inputs and outputs fields contains the addresses to the bitcoin wallets of the senders and the receivers respectively (notice that the addresses aren't linked to sender's and receiver's identity, therefore, provides anonymity).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To this moment, we saw how transactions build a chain that moves value from owner to owner. We also tracked Alice’s transaction, from the moment it was created in her wallet, through the bitcoin network and to the miners who recorded it on the blockchain. In the rest of this notebook, we will examine the specific technologies behind wallets, addresses, signatures, transactions, the network, and finally mining.\n",

    "You may have heard that bitcoin is based on cryptography, which is a branch of mathematics used extensively in computer security. Cryptography means \"secret writing\" in Greek, but the science of cryptography encompasses more than just secret writing, which is referred to as encryption. Cryptography can also be used to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing that secret (digital signature), or prove the authenticity of data (digital fingerprint). These types of cryptographic proofs are the mathematical tools critical to bitcoin and used extensively in bitcoin applications. **Ironically, encryption is not an important part of bitcoin, as its communications and transaction data are not encrypted and do not need to be encrypted to protect the funds.** In this section we will introduce some of the cryptography used in bitcoin to control ownership of funds, in the form of keys, addresses, and wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ownership of bitcoin is established through digital keys, bitcoin addresses, and digital signatures**. The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but are instead created and stored by users in a file, or simple database, called a wallet. **The digital keys in a user’s wallet are completely independent of the bitcoin protocol and can be generated and managed by the user’s wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the internet**. Keys enable many of the interesting properties of bitcoin, including decentralized trust and control, ownership attestation, and the cryptographic-proof security model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Most bitcoin transactions require a valid digital signature to be included in the blockchain, which can only be generated with a secret key; therefore, anyone with a copy of that key has control of the bitcoin. The digital signature used to spend funds is also referred to as a witness, a term used in cryptography. The witness data in a bitcoin transaction serves as an evidence of the true ownership of the funds being spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key**. Think of the public key as similar to a bank account number and the private key as similar to the secret PIN, or signature on a check, that provides control over the account. These digital keys are very rarely seen by the users of bitcoin. For the most part, they are stored inside the wallet file and managed by the bitcoin wallet software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the payment portion of a bitcoin transaction, **the recipient’s public key is represented by its digital fingerprint, called a bitcoin address**, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary name on a check (i.e., \"Pay to the order of\"). **In most cases, a bitcoin address is generated from and corresponds to a public key**. However, not all bitcoin addresses represent public keys; they can also represent other beneficiaries such as scripts, as we will see later in this section. This way, bitcoin addresses abstract the recipient of funds, making transaction destinations flexible, similar to paper checks: a single payment instrument that can be used to pay into people’s accounts, pay into company accounts, pay for bills, or pay to cash. The bitcoin address is the only representation of the keys that users will routinely see, because this is the part they need to share with the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will introduce cryptography and explain the mathematics used in bitcoin. Next, we will look at how keys are generated, stored, and managed. We will review the various encoding formats used to represent private and public keys, addresses, and script addresses. Finally, we will look at advanced use of keys and addresses: vanity, multisignature, and script addresses and paper wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Key Cryptography and Cryptocurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key cryptography was invented in the 1970s and is a mathematical foundation for computer and information security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the invention of public key cryptography, several suitable mathematical functions, such as prime number exponentiation and elliptic curve multiplication, have been discovered. **These mathematical functions are practically irreversible, meaning that they are easy to calculate in one direction and infeasible to calculate in the opposite direction (One-way Functions)**. Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures. **Bitcoin uses elliptic curve multiplication as the basis for its cryptography**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In bitcoin, we use public key cryptography to create a key pair that controls access to bitcoin. The key pair consists of a private key and—​derived from it—​a unique public key. **The public key is used to receive funds, and the private key is used to sign transactions to spend the funds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a mathematical relationship between the public and the private key that allows the private key to be used to generate signatures on messages. This signature can be validated against the public key without revealing the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When spending bitcoin, the current bitcoin owner presents her public key and a signature (different each time, but created from the same private key) in a transaction to spend those bitcoin**. Through the presentation of the public key and signature, everyone in the bitcoin network can verify and accept the transaction as valid, confirming that the person transferring the bitcoin owned them at the time of the transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In most wallet implementations, the private and public keys are stored together as a key pair for convenience. However, the public key can be calculated from the private key, so storing only the private key is also possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private and Public Keys\n",
    "A bitcoin wallet contains a collection of key pairs, each consisting of a private key and a public key. \n",
    "- The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at random. \n",
    "- From the private key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a public key (K).\n",
    "- From the public key (K), we use a one-way cryptographic hash function to generate a bitcoin address (A). That's why a bitcoin address is some times referred to as a digital fingerprint of the public key. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will start with generating the private key, look at the elliptic curve math that is used to turn that into a public key, and finally, generate a bitcoin address from the public key. The relationship between private key, public key, and bitcoin address is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PrivPubAddress.png)<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Asymmetric Cryptography (Public/Private Keys)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is asymmetric cryptography used in bitcoin? It’s not used to \"encrypt\" (make secret) the transactions. Rather, the useful property of asymmetric cryptography is the ability to generate digital signatures. **A private key can be applied to the digital fingerprint of a transaction to produce a numerical signature. This signature can only be produced by someone with knowledge of the private key. However, anyone with access to the public key and the transaction fingerprint can use them to verify the signature**. This useful property of asymmetric cryptography makes it possible for anyone to verify every signature on every transaction, while ensuring that only the owners of private keys can produce valid signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "A private key is simply a number, picked at random. Ownership and control over the private key is the root of user control over all funds associated with the corresponding bitcoin address. The private key is used to create signatures that are required to spend bitcoin by proving ownership of funds used in a transaction. **The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the bitcoin secured by that key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss, because if it’s lost it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are forever lost, too.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The bitcoin private key is just a number. You can pick your private keys randomly using just a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256 times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you can use in a bitcoin wallet. The public key can then be generated from the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a private key from a random number\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness**. Creating a bitcoin key is essentially the same as \"Pick a number between 1 and $2^{256}$.\" The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or repeatable. **Bitcoin software uses the underlying operating system’s random number generators to produce 256 bits of entropy (randomness)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds in order to generate enough entropy/randomness, for example, check this super useful web-based tool [Bit Address](http://bitaddress.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the private key can be any number between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, where n is a constant (n = 1.1578 * 1077, slightly less than $2^{256}$) defined as the order of the elliptic curve used in bitcoin (see Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained). To create such a key, we randomly pick a 256-bit number and check that it is less than n. **In programming terms, this is usually achieved by feeding a larger string of random bits, collected from a cryptographically secure source of randomness, into the SHA-256 hash algorithm, which will conveniently produce a 256-bit number.** If the result is less than n, we have a suitable private key. Otherwise, we simply try again with another random number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: \n",
    ">Do not write your own code to create a random number or use a \"simple\" random number generator offered by your programming language. **Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) with a seed from a source of sufficient entropy**. Study the documentation of the random number generator library you choose to make sure it is cryptographically secure. **Correct implementation of the CSPRNG is critical to the security of the keys.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "The public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication, which is irreversible: K = k * G, where k is the private key, G is a constant point called the generator point, and K is the resulting public key. The reverse operation, known as \"finding the discrete logarithm\"—calculating k if you know K—is as difficult as trying all possible values of k, i.e., a brute-force search. Before we demonstrate how to generate a public key from a private key, let’s look at elliptic curve cryptography in a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Elliptic curve multiplication is a type of function that cryptographers call a \"trap door\" function: it is easy to do in one direction (multiplication) and impossible to do in the reverse direction (division). The owner of the private key can easily create the public key and then share it with the world knowing that no one can reverse the function and calculate the private key from the public key. This mathematical trick becomes the basis for unforgeable and secure digital signatures that prove ownership of bitcoin funds.\n",

    "\n",
    "Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of asymmetric or public key cryptography based on the discrete logarithm problem as expressed by addition and multiplication on the points of an elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EllipticCurve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin uses a specific elliptic curve and set of mathematical constants, as defined in a standard called secp256k1, established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The secp256k1 curve is defined by the following function, which produces an elliptic curve:<br>\n",
    "$\\begin{equation} {y^2 = (x^3 + 7)}~\\text{over}~(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\end{equation}$ <br>\n",
    "or<br>\n",
    "$\\begin{equation} {y^2 \\mod p = (x^3 + 7) \\mod p} \\end{equation}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mod p (modulo prime number p) indicates that this curve is over a finite field of prime order p, also written as \n",
    "$\\mathbb{F}_p$, where p = $2^{256}$ – $2^{32}$ – $2^{9}$ – $2^8$ – $2^7$ – $2^6$ – $2^4$ – 1, a very large prime number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this curve is defined over a finite field of prime order instead of over the real numbers, it looks like a pattern of dots scattered in two dimensions, which makes it difficult to visualize. However, the math is identical to that of an elliptic curve over real numbers. As an example, visualizing an elliptic curve over F(p), with p=17 below shows the same elliptic curve over a much smaller finite field of prime order 17, showing a pattern of dots on a grid. The secp256k1 bitcoin elliptic curve can be thought of as a much more complex pattern of dots on a unfathomably large grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EllipticCurvep=17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, the following is a point P with coordinates (x,y) that is a point on the secp256k1 curve:<br>\n",
    "P = (55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240, 32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elliptic Curve Math** (Refer to the recommended watch first)\n",
    "\n",
    "In elliptic curve math, there is a point called the **\"point at infinity,\"** which roughly corresponds to the role of zero in addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a + operator, called \"addition,\" which has some properties similar to the traditional addition of real numbers that gradeschool children learn. Given two points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 + P2, also on the elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, this third point P3 is calculated by drawing a line between P1 and P2. This line will intersect the elliptic curve in exactly one additional place. Call this point P3' = (x, y). Then reflect in the x-axis to get P3 = (x, –y).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of special cases that explain the need for the \"point at infinity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If P1 and P2 are the same point, the line \"between\" P1 and P2 should extend to be the tangent on the curve at this point P1. This tangent will intersect the curve in exactly one new point. You can use techniques from calculus to determine the slope of the tangent line. These techniques curiously work, even though we are restricting our interest to points on the curve with two integer coordinates!\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases (i.e., if P1 and P2 have the same x values but different y values), the tangent line will be exactly vertical, in which case P3 = \"point at infinity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If P1 is the \"point at infinity,\" then P1 + P2 = P2. Similarly, if P2 is the point at infinity, then P1 + P2 = P1. This shows how the point at infinity plays the role of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that + is associative, which means that (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). That means we can write A + B + C without parentheses and without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined addition, we can define multiplication in the standard way that extends addition. For a point P on the elliptic curve, if k is a whole number, then kP = P + P + P + …​ + P (k times). Note that k is sometimes confusingly called an \"exponent\" in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a Public Key\n",
    "- Starting with a private key in the form of a randomly generated number k, we multiply it by a predetermined point on the curve called the generator point G to produce another point somewhere else on the curve, which is the corresponding public key K. \n",
    "- The generator point is specified as part of the secp256k1 standard and is always the same for all keys in bitcoin: $\\begin{equation} {K = k * G} \\end{equation}$ where k is the private key, G is the generator point, and K is the resulting public key, a point on the curve.\n",
    "- Because the generator point is always the same for all bitcoin users, a private key k multiplied with G will always result in the same public key K. The relationship between k and K is fixed, but can only be calculated in one direction (as it's hard to compute discrete log), from k to K. That’s why a bitcoin address (derived from K) can be shared with anyone and does not reveal the user’s private key (k).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A private key can be converted into a public key, but a public key cannot be converted back into a private key because the math only works one way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the elliptic curve multiplication, we take the private key k generated previously and multiply it with the generator point G to find the public key K:<br>\n",
    "`K = 1E99423A4ED27608A15A2616A2B0E9E52CED330AC530EDCC32C8FFC6A526AEDD * G`\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize multiplication of a point with an integer, we will use the simpler elliptic curve over real numbers—remember, the math is the same. Our goal is to find the multiple kG of the generator point G, which is the same as adding G to itself, k times in a row. In elliptic curves, adding a point to itself is the equivalent of drawing a tangent line on the point and finding where it intersects the curve again, then reflecting that point on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows the process for deriving G, 2G, 4G, as a geometric operation on the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EllipticCurveDerivingGs.png)\n",
    "> Most bitcoin implementations use the OpenSSL cryptographic library to do the elliptic curve math. For example, to derive the public key, the function EC_POINT_mul() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bitcoin Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "A bitcoin address is a string of digits and characters that can be shared with anyone who wants to send you money. Addresses produced from public keys consist of a string of numbers and letters, beginning with the digit \"1.\" Here’s an example of a bitcoin address:`1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy`\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin address is what appears most commonly in a transaction as the \"recipient\" of the funds. If we compare a bitcoin transaction to a paper check, the bitcoin address is the beneficiary, which is what we write on the line after \"Pay to the order of.\" On a paper check, that beneficiary can sometimes be the name of a bank account holder, but can also include corporations, institutions, or even cash. Because paper checks do not need to specify an account, but rather use an abstract name as the recipient of funds, they are very flexible payment instruments. Bitcoin transactions use a similar abstraction, the bitcoin address, to make them very flexible. A bitcoin address can represent the owner of a private/public key pair, or it can represent something else, such as a payment script. For now, let’s examine the simple case, a bitcoin address that represents, and is derived from, a public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The bitcoin address is derived from the public key through the use of one-way cryptographic hashing. A \"hashing algorithm\" or simply \"hash algorithm\" is a one-way function that produces a fingerprint or \"hash\" of an arbitrary-sized input**. Cryptographic hash functions are used extensively in bitcoin: in bitcoin addresses, in script addresses, and in the mining Proof-of-Work algorithm. The algorithms used to make a bitcoin address from a public key are the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) and the RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD), specifically SHA256 and RIPEMD160.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the public key K, we compute the SHA256 hash and then compute the RIPEMD160 hash of the result, producing a 160-bit (20-byte) number:<br> `A = RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))` where K is the public key and A is the resulting bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A bitcoin address is not the same as a public key. Bitcoin addresses are derived from a public key using a one-way function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin addresses are almost always encoded as \"Base58Check\", which uses 58 characters (a Base58 number system) and a checksum to help human readability, avoid ambiguity, and protect against errors in address transcription and entry. Base58Check is also used in many other ways in bitcoin, whenever there is a need for a user to read and correctly transcribe a number, such as a bitcoin address, a private key, an encrypted key, or a script hash. Next, we will examine the mechanics of Base58Check encoding and decoding and the resulting representations. Following illustrates the conversion of a public key into a bitcoin address:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PubKey2Add.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base58 and Base58Check Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent long numbers in a compact way, using fewer symbols, many computer systems use mixed-alphanumeric representations with a base (or radix) higher than 10. For example, whereas the traditional decimal system uses the 10 numerals 0 through 9, the hexadecimal system uses 16, with the letters A through F as the six additional symbols. A number represented in hexadecimal format is shorter than the equivalent decimal representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even more compact, Base64 representation uses 26 lowercase letters, 26 capital letters, 10 numerals, and 2 more characters such as $\"&#x201d;$ and \"/\" to transmit binary data over text-based media such as email. Base64 is most commonly used to add binary attachments to email. **Base58 is a text-based binary-encoding format developed for use in bitcoin and used in many other cryptocurrencies. It offers a balance between compact representation, readability, and error detection and prevention. Base58 is a subset of Base64**, using upper and lowercase letters and numbers, but omitting some characters that are frequently mistaken for one another and can appear identical when displayed in certain fonts. Specifically, Base58 is Base64 without the 0 (number zero), O (capital o), l (lower L), I (capital i), and the symbols $&#x201c;``”$ and \"/\". Or, more simply, it is a set of lowercase and capital letters and numbers without the four (0, O, l, I) just mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin’s Base58 alphabets are as follows: `123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base58Check Encoding**: Added security using Checksum<br>\n",
    "To add extra security against typos or transcription errors, Base58Check is a Base58 encoding format, frequently used in bitcoin, which has a built-in error-checking code. The checksum is an additional four bytes added to the end of the data that is being encoded. **The checksum is derived from the hash of the encoded data and can therefore be used to detect and prevent transcription and typing errors. When presented with Base58Check code, the decoding software will calculate the checksum of the data and compare it to the checksum included in the code. If the two do not match, an error has been introduced and the Base58Check data is invalid**. This prevents a mistyped bitcoin address from being accepted by the wallet software as a valid destination, an error that would otherwise result in loss of funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bitcoin, most of the data presented to the user is Base58Check-encoded to make it compact, easy to read, and easy to detect errors. **The version prefix in Base58Check encoding, as you will see below, is used to create easily distinguishable formats, which when encoded in Base58 contain specific characters at the beginning of the Base58Check-encoded payload. These characters make it easy for humans to identify the type of data that is encoded and how to use it.** This is what differentiates, for example, a Base58Check-encoded bitcoin address that starts with a 1 from a Base58Check-encoded private key WIF that starts with a 5. Some example version prefixes and the resulting Base58 characters are shown below:\n",
    "![](./Images/Base58CheckVersionPrefix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is the **procedure to convert data (a number) into a Base58Check format**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Base58CheckEncoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first add a prefix to the data, called the \"version byte,\" which serves to easily identify the type of data that is encoded. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we compute the \"double-SHA\" checksum, meaning we apply the SHA256 hash-algorithm twice on the previous result (prefix and data), that is, `checksum = SHA256(SHA256(prefix+data))`. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the resulting 32-byte hash (hash-of-a-hash), we take only the first four bytes. These four bytes serve as the error-checking code, or checksum. The checksum is concatenated (appended) to the end.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The result is composed of three items: a prefix, the data, and a checksum. This result is encoded using the Base58 alphabet described previously. The image below illustrates the Base58Check encoding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Formats\n",
    "Both private and public keys can be represented in a number of different formats. These representations all encode the same number, even though they look different. **These formats are primarily used to make it easy for people to read and transcribe keys without introducing errors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private Key Formats**<br>\n",
    "The private key can be represented in a number of different formats, all of which correspond to the same 256-bit number. The image below shows three common formats used to represent private keys. Different formats are used in different circumstances. **Hexadecimal and raw binary formats are used internally in software and rarely shown to users. The WIF (Wallet Import Format) is used for import/export of keys between wallets and often used in QR code (barcode) representations of private keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PrivateKeyRepresentations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these representations are different ways of showing the same number, the same private key. They look different, but any one format can easily be converted to any other format. Note that the \"raw binary\" is not shown in Example: Same key, different formats as any encoding for display here would, by definition, not be raw binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public Key Formats**<br>\n",
    "Public keys are also presented in different ways, usually as **either compressed or uncompressed public keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw previously, the public key is a point on the elliptic curve consisting of a pair of coordinates (x,y). It is usually presented with the prefix 04 followed by two 256-bit numbers: one for the x coordinate of the point, the other for the y coordinate. **The prefix 04 is used to distinguish uncompressed public keys from compressed public keys that begin with a 02 or a 03**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the public key generated by the private key we created earlier, shown as the coordinates x and y (this is public key as a point):<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Here’s the same public key shown as a 520-bit number (130 hex digits) with the prefix 04 followed by x and then y coordinates, as 04 x y:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Compressed Public Keys**\n",

    "**Compressed public keys were introduced to bitcoin to reduce the size of transactions and conserve disk space on nodes that store the bitcoin blockchain database**. Most transactions include the public key, which is required to validate the owner’s credentials and spend the bitcoin. **Each public key requires 520 bits (prefix + x + y)**, which when multiplied by several hundred transactions per block, or tens of thousands of transactions per day, adds a significant amount of data to the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the section Public Keys, a public key is a point (x,y) on an elliptic curve. Because the curve expresses a mathematical function, a point on the curve represents a solution to the equation and, therefore, **if we know the x coordinate we can calculate the y coordinate by solving the equation y2 mod p = (x3 + 7) mod p. That allows us to store only the x coordinate of the public key point, omitting the y coordinate and reducing the size of the key and the space required to store it by 256 bits. An almost 50% reduction in size in every transaction adds up to a lot of data saved over time!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Whereas uncompressed public keys have a prefix of 04, compressed public keys start with either a 02 or a 03 prefix**. Let’s look at why there are two possible prefixes: because the left side of the equation is y2, the solution for y is a square root, which can have a positive or negative value. Visually, this means that the resulting y coordinate can be above or below the x-axis. As you can see from the graph of the elliptic curve in An elliptic curve, the curve is symmetric, meaning it is reflected like a mirror by the x-axis. **So, while we can omit the y coordinate we have to store the sign of y (positive or negative); or in other words, we have to remember if it was above or below the x-axis because each of those options represents a different point and a different public key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PublicKeyCompression.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When calculating the elliptic curve in binary arithmetic on the finite field of prime order p, the y coordinate is either even or odd, which corresponds to the positive/negative sign**, that is, say if p = 17, then imagine if we solve the elliptic curve equation and end up having $y^2$ mod p = 4, that means, y could be either +2 or -2, where +2 mod p corresponds to 2(which is even), while -2 corresponds to 15 (17-2), which is odd.  Therefore, to distinguish between the two possible values of y, we store a compressed public key with the prefix **02 if the y is even (+y), and 03 if it is odd (-y)**, allowing the software to correctly deduce the y coordinate from the x coordinate and uncompress the public key to the full coordinates of the point. Public key compression is illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the same public key generated previously, shown as a compressed public key stored in 264 bits (66 hex digits) with the prefix 03 indicating the y coordinate is odd:\n",
    "\n",
    "`K = 03F028892BAD7ED57D2FB57BF33081D5CFCF6F9ED3D3D7F159C2E2FFF579DC341A`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Address Problem: Compressed Vs Uncompressed Public Key:**<br>\n",
    "This compressed public key corresponds to the same private key, meaning it is generated from the same private key. However, it looks different from the uncompressed public key. More importantly, if we convert this compressed public key to a bitcoin address using the double-hash function `RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))` it will produce a different bitcoin address. This can be confusing, because it means that a single private key can produce a public key expressed in two different formats (compressed and uncompressed) that produce two different bitcoin addresses. However, the private key is identical for both bitcoin addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compressed public keys are gradually becoming the default across bitcoin clients, which is having a significant impact on reducing the size of transactions and therefore the blockchain**. However, not all clients support compressed public keys yet. Newer clients that support compressed public keys have to account for transactions from older clients that do not support compressed public keys. This is especially important when a wallet application is importing private keys from another bitcoin wallet application, because the new wallet needs to scan the blockchain to find transactions corresponding to these imported keys. **Which bitcoin addresses should the bitcoin wallet scan for? The bitcoin addresses produced by uncompressed public keys, or the bitcoin addresses produced by compressed public keys? Both are valid bitcoin addresses, and can be signed for by the private key, but they are different addresses!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    ">**To resolve this issue, when private keys are exported from a wallet, the WIF that is used to represent them is implemented differently in newer bitcoin wallets, to indicate that these private keys have been used to produce compressed public keys and therefore compressed bitcoin addresses**. This allows the importing wallet to distinguish between private keys originating from older or newer wallets and search the blockchain for transactions with bitcoin addresses corresponding to the uncompressed, or the compressed, public keys, respectively. Let’s look at how this works in more detail, next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compressed private keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ironically, the term \"compressed private key\" is a misnomer**, because when a private key is exported as WIF-compressed it is actually one byte longer than an \"uncompressed\" private key. That is because the private key has an added one-byte suffix (shown as 01 in Hex-compressed in image below), which signifies that the private key is from a newer wallet and should only be used to produce compressed public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private keys are not themselves compressed and cannot be compressed. The term \"compressed private key\" really means \"private key from which only compressed public keys should be derived,\" whereas \"uncompressed private key\" really means \"private key from which only uncompressed public keys should be derived\".** You should only refer to the export format as \"WIF-compressed\" or \"WIF\" and not refer to the private key itself as \"compressed\" to avoid further confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PrivateKeyFormats.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the hex-compressed private key format has one extra byte at the end (01 in hex). While the Base58 encoding version prefix is the same (0x80) for both WIF and WIF-compressed formats, the addition of one byte on the end of the number causes the first character of the Base58 encoding to change from a 5 to either a K or L. Think of this as the Base58 equivalent of the decimal encoding difference between the number 100 and the number 99. While 100 is one digit longer than 99, it also has a prefix of 1 instead of a prefix of 9. As the length changes, it affects the prefix. In Base58, the prefix 5 changes to a K or L as the length of the number increases by one byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, these formats are not used interchangeably. In a newer wallet that implements compressed public keys, the private keys will only ever be exported as WIF-compressed (with a K or L prefix). If the wallet is an older implementation and does not use compressed public keys, the private keys will only ever be exported as WIF (with a 5 prefix). The goal here is to signal to the wallet importing these private keys whether it must search the blockchain for compressed or uncompressed public keys and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \"Compressed private keys\" is a misnomer! They are not compressed; rather, **WIF-compressed signifies that the keys should only be used to derive compressed public keys and their corresponding bitcoin addresses**. Ironically, a \"WIF-compressed\" encoded private key is one byte longer because it has the added 01 suffix to distinguish it from an \"uncompressed\" one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "> If a bitcoin wallet is able to implement compressed public keys, it will use those in all transactions. The private keys in the wallet will be used to derive the public key points on the curve, which will be compressed. The compressed public keys will be used to produce bitcoin addresses and those will be used in transactions. When exporting private keys from a new wallet that implements compressed public keys, the WIF is modified, with the addition of a one-byte suffix 01 to the private key. The resulting Base58Check-encoded private key is called a \"compressed WIF\" and starts with the letter K or L, instead of starting with \"5\" as is the case with WIF-encoded (noncompressed) keys from older wallets.\n",

    "### Advanced Keys and Addresses\n",
    "In the following sections we will look at advanced forms of keys and addresses, such as encrypted private keys, script and multisignature addresses, vanity addresses, and paper wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encrypted Private Keys (BIP-38)\n",
    "\n",
    "Private keys must remain secret. The need for confidentiality of the private keys is a truism that is quite difficult to achieve in practice, because it conflicts with the equally important security objective of availability. **Keeping the private key private is much harder when you need to store backups of the private key to avoid losing it**. A private key stored in a wallet that is encrypted by a password might be secure, but that wallet needs to be backed up. At times, users need to move keys from one wallet to another—to upgrade or replace the wallet software, for example.**Private key backups might also be stored on paper (see Paper Wallets) or on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive. But what if the backup itself is stolen or lost?** These conflicting security goals led to the introduction of a **portable and convenient standard for encrypting private keys in a way that can be understood by many different wallets and bitcoin clients, standardized by BIP-38.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal**. A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a design document for introducing features or information to Bitcoin. This is the standard way of communicating ideas since Bitcoin has no formal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-38 proposes a common standard for encrypting private keys with a passphrase and encoding them with Base58Check** so that they can be stored securely on backup media, transported securely between wallets, or kept in any other conditions where the key might be exposed. **The standard for encryption uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**, a standard established by the NIST and used broadly in data encryption implementations for commercial and military applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-38 Encryption Scheme**:<br>\n",
    "- It takes as input a bitcoin private key, usually encoded in the WIF, as a Base58Check string with the prefix of \"5\".\n",
    "- Additionally, the BIP-38 encryption scheme takes a passphrase—a long password—usually composed of several words or a complex string of alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "- The result of the BIP-38 encryption scheme is a **Base58Check-encoded encrypted private key that begins with the prefix 6P**. If you see a key that starts with 6P, it is encrypted and requires a passphrase in order to convert (decrypt) it back into a WIF-formatted private key (prefix 5) that can be used in any wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many wallet applications now recognize BIP-38-encrypted private keys and will prompt the user for a passphrase to decrypt and import the key. Third-party applications, such as the incredibly useful browser-based [Bit Address](http://bitaddress.org/) (Wallet Details tab), can be used to decrypt BIP-38 keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use case for BIP-38 encrypted keys is for paper wallets that can be used to back up private keys on a piece of paper. As long as the user selects a strong passphrase, a paper wallet with BIP-38 encrypted private keys is incredibly secure and a great way to create offline bitcoin storage (also known as \"cold storage\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the encrypted keys in given below using [Bit Address](http://bitaddress.org/)(Wallet details tab) to see how you can get the decrypted key by entering the passphrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BIP-38EncryptedPrivKeyEx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pay-to-Script Hash (P2SH) and Multisig Addresses\n",
    "As we know, traditional bitcoin addresses begin with the number “1” and are derived from the public key, which is derived from the private key. Although anyone can send bitcoin to a “1” address, that bitcoin can only be spent by presenting the corresponding private key signature and public key hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin addresses that begin with the number “3” are pay-to-script hash (P2SH) addresses, sometimes erroneously called multisignature or multisig addresses. They designate the beneficiary of a bitcoin transaction as the hash of a script, instead of the owner of a public key**. The feature was introduced in January 2012 with **BIP-16**, and is being **widely adopted because it provides the opportunity to add functionality to the address itself**. Unlike transactions that \"send\" funds to traditional “1” bitcoin addresses, also known as a pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH), **funds sent to “3” addresses require something more than the presentation of one public key hash and one private key signature as proof of ownership. The requirements are designated at the time the address is created, within the script, and all inputs to this address will be encumbered with the same requirements.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A P2SH address is created from a transaction script, which defines who can spend a transaction output. Encoding a P2SH address involves using the same double-hash function as used during creation of a bitcoin address, only applied on the script instead of the public key:<br> `script hash = RIPEMD160(SHA256(script))` <br>\n",
    "The resulting \"script hash\" is encoded with Base58Check with a version prefix of 5, which results in an encoded address starting with a 3. An example of a P2SH address is `3F6i6kwkevjR7AsAd4te2YB2zZyASEm1HM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **P2SH is not necessarily the same as a multisignature standard transaction**. A P2SH address most often represents a multi-signature script, but it might also represent a script encoding other types of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multisignature addresses and P2SH\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the most common implementation of the P2SH function is the multi-signature address script. As the name implies, the underlying script requires more than one signature to prove ownership and therefore spend funds. **The bitcoin multi-signature feature is designed to require M signatures (also known as the “threshold”) from a total of N keys, known as an M-of-N multisig, where M is equal to or less than N**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: Bob the coffee shop owner could use a multisignature address requiring 1-of-2 signatures from a key belonging to him and a key belonging to his spouse, ensuring either of them could sign to spend a transaction output locked to this address. This would be similar to a “joint account” as implemented in traditional banking where either spouse can spend with a single signature. Or Gopesh, the web designer paid by Bob to create a website, might have a 2-of-3 multisignature address for his business that ensures that no funds can be spent unless at least two of the business partners sign a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore how to create transactions that spend funds from P2SH (and multi-signature) addresses in the upcoming Transactions section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vanity Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanity addresses are valid bitcoin addresses that contain human-readable messages. For example, `1LoveBPzzD72PUXLzCkYAtGFYmK5vYNR33` is a valid address that contains the letters forming the word \"Love\" as the first four Base-58 letters. Vanity addresses require generating and testing billions of candidate private keys, until a bitcoin address with the desired pattern is found. Although there are some optimizations in the vanity generation algorithm, **the process essentially involves picking a private key at random, deriving the public key, deriving the bitcoin address, and checking to see if it matches the desired vanity pattern, repeating billions of times until a match is found**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a vanity address matching the desired pattern is found, the private key from which it was derived can be used by the owner to spend bitcoin in exactly the same way as any other address. Vanity addresses are no less or more secure than any other address. They depend on the same Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and SHA as any other address. You can no more easily find the private key of an address starting with a vanity pattern than you can any other address.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories), we introduced Eugenia, a children’s charity director operating in the Philippines. Let’s say that Eugenia is organizing a bitcoin fundraising drive and wants to use a vanity bitcoin address to publicize the fundraising. Eugenia will create a vanity address that starts with \"1Kids\" to promote the children’s charity fundraiser. Let’s see how this vanity address will be created and what it means for the security of Eugenia’s charity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generating vanity addresses**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to realize that a bitcoin address is simply a number represented by symbols in the Base58 alphabet. The search for a pattern like \"1Kids\" can be seen as searching for an address in the range from 1Kids11111111111111111111111111111 to 1Kidszzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. There are approximately $58^{29}$ (approximately 1.4 * $10^{51}$) addresses in that range, all starting with \"1Kids.\" The range of vanity addresses starting with \"1Kids\" shows the range of addresses that have the prefix 1Kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the pattern \"1Kids\" as a number and see how frequently we might find this pattern in a bitcoin address. An average desktop computer PC, without any specialized hardware, can search approximately 100,000 keys per second.\n",
    "![](./Images/FrequencyOfVanityPattern.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Eugenia won’t be creating the vanity address \"1KidsCharity\" anytime soon, even if she had access to several thousand computers. Each additional character increases the difficulty by a factor of 58. Patterns with more than seven characters are usually found by specialized hardware, such as custom-built desktops with multiple GPUs. These are often repurposed bitcoin mining \"rigs\" that are no longer profitable for bitcoin mining but can be used to find vanity addresses. Vanity searches on GPU systems are many orders of magnitude faster than on a general-purpose CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another way to find a vanity address is to outsource the work to a pool of vanity miners**, such as the pool at [Vanity Pool](http://vanitypool.appspot.com/). A pool is a service that allows those with GPU hardware to earn bitcoin searching for vanity addresses for others. For a small payment (0.01 bitcoin or approximately 5 USD at the time of this writing), Eugenia can outsource the search for a seven-character pattern vanity address and get results in a few hours instead of having to run a CPU search for months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Generating a vanity address is a brute-force exercise: try a random key, check the resulting address to see if it matches the desired pattern, repeat until successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vanity address security\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vanity addresses can be used to enhance and to defeat security measures; they are truly a double-edged sword**. Used to improve security, a distinctive address makes it harder for adversaries to substitute their own address and fool your customers into paying them instead of you. Unfortunately, vanity addresses also make it possible for anyone to create an address that resembles any random address, or even another vanity address which is similar to our vanity address, thereby fooling your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eugenia could advertise a randomly generated address (e.g., `1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy`) to which people can send their donations. Or, she could generate a vanity address that starts with `1Kids`, to make it more distinctive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, **one of the risks of using a single fixed address (rather than a separate dynamic address per donor) is that a thief might be able to infiltrate your website and replace it with his own address, thereby diverting donations to himself**. If you have advertised your donation address in a number of different places, your users may visually inspect the address before making a payment to ensure it is the same one they saw on your website, on your email, and on your flyer. In the case of a random address like `1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy`, the average user will perhaps inspect the first few characters \"1J7mdg\" and be satisfied that the address matches. Using a vanity address generator, someone with the intent to steal by substituting a similar-looking address can quickly generate addresses that match the first few characters, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/VanityAdd2MatchRandAdd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So does a vanity address increase security? If Eugenia generates the vanity address (1Kids) `1Kids33q44erFfpeXrmDSz7zEqG2FesZEN`, users are likely to look at the vanity pattern word and a few characters beyond, for example noticing the \"1Kids33\" part of the address. That would force an attacker to generate a vanity address matching at least six characters (two more), expending an effort that is 3,364 times (58 × 58) higher than the effort Eugenia expended for her 4-character vanity. Essentially, the effort Eugenia expends (or pays a vanity pool for) \"pushes\" the attacker into having to produce a longer pattern vanity. **If Eugenia pays a pool to generate an 8-character vanity address, the attacker would be pushed into the realm of 10 characters, which is infeasible on a personal computer and expensive even with a custom vanity-mining rig or vanity pool**. What is affordable for Eugenia becomes unaffordable for the attacker, especially if the potential reward of fraud is not high enough to cover the cost of the vanity address generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paper Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Paper wallets are bitcoin private keys printed on paper**. Often the paper wallet also includes the corresponding bitcoin address for convenience, but this is not necessary because it can be derived from the private key. Paper wallets are a very effective way to create backups or offline bitcoin storage, also known as **\"cold storage\"**. As a backup mechanism, a paper wallet can provide security against the loss of key due to a computer mishap such as a hard-drive failure, theft, or accidental deletion. As a \"cold storage\" mechanism, if the paper wallet keys are generated offline and never stored on a computer system, they are much more secure against hackers, keyloggers, and other online computer threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper wallets come in many shapes, sizes, and designs, but at a very basic level are just a key and an address printed on paper (Not Recommended due to Security Concerns). \n",
    "\n",
    "Paper wallets can be generated easily using a tool such as the client-side JavaScript generator at [Bit Address](http://bitaddress.org/). This page contains all the code necessary to generate keys and paper wallets, even while completely disconnected from the internet. To use it, save the HTML page on your local drive or on an external USB flash drive. Disconnect from the internet and open the file in a browser. Even better, boot your computer using a pristine operating system, such as a CD-ROM bootable Linux OS. Any keys generated with this tool while offline can be printed on a local printer over a USB cable (not wirelessly), thereby creating paper wallets whose keys exist only on the paper and have never been stored on any online system. Put these paper wallets in a fireproof safe and \"send\" bitcoin to their bitcoin address, to implement a simple yet highly effective \"cold storage\" solution. An example of a simple paper wallet from bitaddress.org is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/SimplePaperWallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of a simple paper wallet system is that the printed keys are vulnerable to theft. A thief who is able to gain access to the paper can either steal it or photograph the keys and take control of the bitcoin locked with those keys. **A more sophisticated paper wallet storage system uses BIP-38 encrypted private keys. The keys printed on the paper wallet are protected by a passphrase that the owner has memorized. Without the passphrase, the encrypted keys are useless**. Yet, they still are superior to a passphrase-protected wallet because the keys have never been online and must be physically retrieved from a safe or other physically secured storage. An example of an encrypted paper wallet from bitaddress.org:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EncryptedPaperWallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The private key starts with 6P which essentially means that the private key is BIP-38 encrypted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning:\n",
    "> Although you can deposit funds into a paper wallet several times, you should withdraw all funds only once, spending everything. This is because in the process of unlocking and spending funds some wallets might generate a change address if you spend less than the whole amount. Additionally, if the computer you use to sign the transaction is compromised, you risk exposing the private key. By spending the entire balance of a paper wallet only once, you reduce the risk of key compromise. If you need only a small amount, send any remaining funds to a new paper wallet in the same transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper wallets come in many designs and sizes, with many different features. Some are intended to be given as gifts and have seasonal themes, such as Christmas and New Year’s themes. Others are designed for storage in a bank vault or safe with the private key hidden in some way, either with opaque scratch-off stickers, or folded and sealed with tamper-proof adhesive foil. Figures below show various examples of paper wallets with security and backup features.\n",

    "# Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"wallet\" is used to describe a few different things in bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At a high level, a wallet is an application that serves as the primary user interface**. The wallet controls access to a user’s money, managing keys and addresses, tracking the balance, and creating and signing transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More narrowly, from a programmer’s perspective, the word \"wallet\" refers to the data structure used to store and manage a user’s keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, **we will look at the second meaning, where wallets are containers for private keys, usually implemented as structured files or simple databases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wallet Technology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we summarize the various technologies used to construct user-friendly, secure, and flexible bitcoin wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A common misconception about bitcoin is that bitcoin wallets contain bitcoin. In fact, **the wallet contains only keys. The \"coins\" are recorded in the blockchain on the bitcoin network**. Users control the coins on the network by signing transactions with the keys in their wallets. In a sense, a bitcoin wallet is a **keychain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Bitcoin wallets contain keys, not coins. Each user has a wallet containing keys. Wallets are really keychains containing pairs of private/public keys. **Users sign transactions with the keys, thereby proving they own the transaction outputs (their coins). The coins are stored on the blockchain in the form of transaction outputs (often noted as vout or txout)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two primary types of wallets, distinguished by whether the keys they contain are related to each other or not**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first type is a **nondeterministic wallet**, where each key is independently generated from a random number. The keys are not related to each other. This type of wallet is also known as a **JBOK wallet from the phrase \"Just a Bunch Of Keys\"**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second type of wallet is a **deterministic wallet**, where all the keys are derived from a single master key, known as the seed. All the keys in this type of wallet are related to each other and can be generated again if one has the original seed. There are a number of different key derivation methods used in deterministic wallets. The most **commonly used key derivation method uses a tree-like structure and is known as a hierarchical deterministic or HD wallet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic wallets are initialized from a seed. To make these easier to use, seeds are encoded as English words, also known as mnemonic code words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few sections introduce each of these technologies at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nondeterministic (Random) Wallets [Type-0]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first bitcoin wallet (now called Bitcoin Core), wallets were collections of randomly generated private keys. For example, the original Bitcoin Core client pregenerates 100 random private keys when first started and generates more keys as needed, using each key only once. **Such wallets are being replaced with deterministic wallets because they are cumbersome to manage, back up, and import**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The disadvantage of random keys is that if you generate many of them you must keep copies of all of them, meaning that the wallet must be backed up frequently**. Each key must be backed up, or the funds it controls are irrevocably lost if the wallet becomes inaccessible. This conflicts directly with the principle of avoiding address reuse, by using each bitcoin address for only one transaction. Address reuse reduces privacy by associating multiple transactions and addresses with each other. **A Type-0 nondeterministic wallet is a poor choice of wallet, especially if you want to avoid address reuse because it means that we would be using many keys to derive different addresses and from a  Type-0 wallet perspectives that mean managing many keys, which creates the need for frequent backups.** Although the Bitcoin Core client includes a Type-0 wallet, using this wallet is discouraged by developers of Bitcoin Core.

    "### Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets [Type-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic, or \"seeded,\" wallets are wallets that contain private keys that are all derived from a common seed, through the use of a one-way hash function**. The seed is a randomly generated number that is combined with other data, such as an index number or \"chain code\" (we will see that shortly) to derive the private keys. **In a deterministic wallet, the seed is sufficient to recover all the derived keys, and therefore a single backup at creation time is sufficient**. The seed is also sufficient for a wallet export or import, allowing for **easy migration of all the user’s keys between different wallet implementations**. Following depicts a logical diagram of a deterministic wallet:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Type-1DeterministicWallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### HD Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44) [Type-2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic wallets were developed to make it easy to derive many keys from a single \"seed.\" The most advanced form of deterministic wallets is the HD wallet defined by the BIP-32 standard. **HD wallets contain keys derived in a tree structure, such that a parent key can derive a sequence of children keys, each of which can derive a sequence of grandchildren keys, and so on, to an infinite depth**. This tree structure is illustrated in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HD-Wallets.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "HD wallets offer two major advantages over random (nondeterministic) keys:\n",
    "- First, the tree structure can be used to express additional organizational meaning, such as when a specific branch of subkeys is used to receive incoming payments and a different branch is used to receive change from outgoing payments. Branches of keys can also be used in corporate settings, allocating different branches to departments, subsidiaries, specific functions, or accounting categories.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second advantage of HD wallets is that users can create a sequence of public keys without having access to the corresponding private keys. This allows HD wallets to be used on an insecure server or in a receive-only capacity, issuing a different public key for each transaction. The public keys do not need to be preloaded or derived in advance, yet the server doesn’t have the private keys that can spend the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "HD wallets are a very powerful mechanism for managing many keys and addresses. They are even more useful if they are combined with a **standardized way of creating seeds from a sequence of English words that are easy to transcribe, export, and import across wallets. This is known as a mnemonic and the standard is defined by BIP-39**. \n",
    "\n",

    "`army van defense carry jealous true garbage claim echo media make crunch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most bitcoin wallets (as well as wallets for other cryptocurrencies) use this standard and can import and export seeds for backup and recovery using interoperable mnemonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wallet Best Practices\n",
    "As bitcoin wallet technology has matured, certain common industry standards have emerged that make bitcoin wallets broadly interoperable, easy to use, secure, and flexible. These common standards are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mnemonic code words**, based on BIP-39\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HD wallets**, based on BIP-32\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multipurpose HD wallet structure**, based on BIP-43\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multicurrency and multiaccount wallets**, based on BIP-44\n",
    "\n",
    "These standards may change or may become obsolete by future developments, but for now they form a set of interlocking technologies that have become the de facto wallet standard for bitcoin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standards have been adopted by a broad range of software and hardware bitcoin wallets, making all these wallets interoperable. A user can export a mnemonic generated on one of these wallets and import it in another wallet, recovering all transactions, keys, and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example of software wallets supporting these standards include (listed alphabetically) Breadwallet, Copay, Multibit HD, and Mycelium. Examples of hardware wallets supporting these standards include (listed alphabetically) Keepkey, Ledger, and Trezor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: If you are implementing a bitcoin wallet, it should be built as a HD wallet, with a seed encoded as mnemonic code for backup, following the BIP-32, BIP-39, BIP-43, and BIP-44 standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Bitcoin Wallet\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories) we introduced Gabriel, an enterprising young teenager in Rio de Janeiro, who is running a simple web store that sells bitcoin-branded t-shirts, coffee mugs, and stickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel uses a Trezor bitcoin hardware wallet to securely manage his bitcoin. The Trezor is a simple USB device with two buttons that stores keys (in the form of an HD wallet) and signs transactions. Trezor wallets implement all the industry standards discussed in this chapter, so Gabriel is not reliant on any proprietary technology or single vendor solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TrezorDevice.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When Gabriel used the Trezor for the first time, the device generated a mnemonic and seed from a built-in hardware random number generator. During this initialization phase, the wallet displayed a numbered sequence of words, one by one, on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "By writing down this mnemonic, Gabriel created a backup (as shown below) that can be used for recovery in the case of loss or damage to the Trezor device. This mnemonic can be used for recovery in a new Trezor or in any one of the many compatible software or hardware wallets. Note that the sequence of words is important, so mnemonic paper backups have numbered spaces for each word. Gabriel had to carefully record each word in the numbered space to preserve the correct sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PaperBackUpOfMnemonic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A 12-word mnemonic is shown in Gabriel’s paper backup of the mnemonic, for simplicity. In fact, **most hardware wallets generate a more secure 24-word mnemonic**. The mnemonic is used in exactly the same way, regardless of length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first implementation of his web store, Gabriel uses a single bitcoin address, generated on his Trezor device. This single address is used by all customers for all orders. As we will see, this approach has some drawbacks and can be improved upon with an HD wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wallet Technology Details\n",
    "Let’s now examine each of the important industry standards that are used by many bitcoin wallets in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mnemonic Code Words (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mnemonic code words are word sequences that represent a random number used as a seed to derive a deterministic wallet. The sequence of words is sufficient to re-create the seed and from there re-create the wallet and all the derived keys. A wallet application that implements deterministic wallets with mnemonic words will show the user a sequence of 12 to 24 words when first creating a wallet. That sequence of words is the wallet backup and can be used to recover and re-create all the keys in the same or any compatible wallet application. Mnemonic words make it easier for users to back up wallets because they are easy to read and correctly transcribe, as compared to a random sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mnemonic words are often confused with **brainwallets**. They are not the same. The primary difference is that a brainwallet consists of words chosen by the user, whereas mnemonic words are created randomly by the wallet and presented to the user. **This important difference makes mnemonic words much more secure, because humans are very poor sources of randomness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: BIP-39 has now achieved broad industry support across dozens of interoperable implementations and should be considered the de facto industry standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-39 defines the creation of a mnemonic code and seed, which we describe here in nine steps. For clarity, the process is split into two parts: steps 1 through 6 are shown in the image (Mnemonic Words) and steps 7 through 9 are shown in a later image(Mnemonic to Seed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating mnemonic words\n",
    "Mnemonic words are generated automatically by the wallet using the standardized process defined in BIP-39. The wallet starts from a source of entropy, adds a checksum, and then maps the entropy to a word list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a random sequence (entropy) of 128 to 256 bits, say from a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a checksum of the random sequence by taking the first (entropy-length/32, here 128/32) bits of its SHA256 hash.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the checksum to the end of the random sequence.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Split the result into 11-bit length segments.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Map each 11-bit value to a word from the predefined dictionary (BIP39 English Word List) of 2048 words.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The mnemonic code is the sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following depicts how entropy is used to generate mnemonic words:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/GenMnemonicWords.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following shows the relationship between the size of the entropy data and the length of mnemonic codes in words:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Entropy&WordLen.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From mnemonic to seed\n",
    "The mnemonic words represent entropy with a length of 128 to 256 bits. **The entropy is then used to derive a longer (512-bit) seed through the use of the key-stretching function PBKDF2**. The seed produced is then used to build a deterministic wallet and derive its keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key-stretching function takes two parameters: the mnemonic and a salt. **The purpose of a salt in a key-stretching function is to make it difficult to build a lookup table enabling a brute-force attack**. In the BIP-39 standard, the salt has another purpose—it allows the introduction of a passphrase that serves as an additional security factor protecting the seed, as we will describe in more detail under Optional passphrase in BIP-39.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process described in steps 7 through 9 continues from the process described previously in Generating mnemonic words:\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The first parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is the mnemonic produced from step 6.<br><br>\n",
    "8. The second parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is a salt. The salt is composed of the string constant \"mnemonic\" concatenated with an optional user-supplied passphrase string.<br><br>\n",
    "9. PBKDF2 stretches the mnemonic and salt parameters using 2048 rounds of hashing with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm, producing a 512-bit value as its final output. That 512-bit value is the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Mnemonic2Seed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **The key-stretching function, with its 2048 rounds of hashing, is a very effective protection against brute-force attacks against the mnemonic or the passphrase**. It makes it extremely costly (in computation) to try more than a few thousand passphrase and mnemonic combinations, while the number of possible derived seeds is vast ($2^{512}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Tables show some examples of mnemonic codes and the seeds they produce:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Mnemonic2Seed-Ex.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional passphrase in BIP-39\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIP-39 standard allows the use of an optional passphrase in the derivation of the seed. **If no passphrase is used, the mnemonic is stretched with a salt consisting of the constant string \"mnemonic\", producing a specific 512-bit seed from any given mnemonic**. If a passphrase is used, the stretching function produces a different seed from that same mnemonic. In fact, **given a single mnemonic, every possible passphrase leads to a different seed**. All passphrases are valid and they all lead to different seeds, forming a vast set of possible uninitialized wallets. **The set of possible wallets is so large ($2^{512}$) that there is no practical possibility of brute-forcing or accidentally guessing one that is in use.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are no \"wrong\" passphrases in BIP-39. Every passphrase leads to some wallet, which unless previously used will be empty. <br>**Each wallet is characterized by its seed, therefore as different passphrases, when undergo key-stretching function as salts alongside mnemonics, results in different seeds and therefore, we say, different wallets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional passphrase creates two important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A second factor (something memorized) that makes a mnemonic useless on its own, protecting mnemonic backups from compromise by a thief.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A form of plausible deniability or **duress wallet**, where a chosen passphrase leads to a wallet with a small amount of funds used to distract an attacker from the \"real\" wallet that contains the majority of funds, that is, different passphrase as salt with the mnemonic in the key-stretching function would result in different seed which would lead to different private keys which can take charge of different amount of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the use of a passphrase also introduces the risk of loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the wallet owner is incapacitated or dead and no one else knows the passphrase, the seed is useless and all the funds stored in the wallet are lost forever.\n",
    "- Conversely, if the owner backs up the passphrase in the same place as the seed, it defeats the purpose of a second factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "While passphrases are very useful, they should only be used in combination with a carefully planned process for backup and recovery, considering the possibility of surviving the owner and allowing his or her family to recover the cryptocurrency estate.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Creating an HD Wallet from the Seed\n",
    "HD wallets are created from a single root seed, which is a 128-, 256-, or 512-bit random number. Most commonly, this seed is generated from a mnemonic as detailed in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every key in the HD wallet is deterministically derived from this root seed, which makes it possible to re-create the entire HD wallet from that seed**. This makes it easy to back up, restore, export, and import HD wallets containing thousands or even millions of keys by **simply transferring only the mnemonic that the root seed is derived from**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating the master keys and master chain code for an HD wallet is shown in \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/MasterKey&ChainCode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The root seed is input into the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm and the resulting hash is used to create a master private key (m) and a master chain code (c).\n",
    "- The master private key (m) then generates a corresponding master public key (M) using the normal elliptic curve multiplication process m * G.\n",
    "- The **chain code (c) is used to introduce entropy in the function that creates child keys from parent keys**, as we will see in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Private child key derivation\n",
    "HD wallets use a child key derivation (CKD) function to derive child keys from parent keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child key derivation functions are based on a one-way hash function that combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A parent private or public key (ECDSA uncompressed key)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A seed called a chain code (256 bits)\n",
    "\n",
    "- An index number (32 bits) [can be interpreted as child number]\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain code is used to introduce deterministic random data to the process, so that knowing the index and a child key is not sufficient to derive other child keys. Knowing a child key does not make it possible to find its siblings, unless you also have the chain code. The initial chain code seed (at the root of the tree) is made from the seed, while subsequent child chain codes are derived from each parent chain code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**These three items (parent key, chain code, and index) are combined and hashed to generate children keys, as follows**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The parent public key, chain code, and the index number are combined and hashed with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm to produce a 512-bit hash. \n",
    "- This 512-bit hash is split into two 256-bit halves. The right-half 256 bits of the hash output become the chain code for the child (which would be used while deriving its child). \n",
    "- The left-half 256 bits of the hash are added to the parent private key to produce the child private key, which would then be used to derive the child public key using elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Parent2ChildKey.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above image illustrated with the index set to 0 to produce the \"zero\" (first by index) child of the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ques: Why is Public key 264 bit, while private key is 256?<br>\n",
    "Ans: It has an 8 bit prefix (tells whether y is even or odd) and 256 bit to represent coordinate x as seen earlier in the Generating public key section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changing the index allows us to extend the parent and create the other children in the sequence**, e.g., Child 0, Child 1, Child 2, etc. Each parent key can have 2,147,483,647 ($2^{31}$) children ($2^{31}$ is half of the entire $2^{32}$ range available because the other half is reserved for a special type of derivation, hardened derivation, which we will talk about later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating the process one level down the tree, each child can in turn become a parent and create its own children, in an infinite number of generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using derived child keys\n",
    "\n",
    "**Child private keys are indistinguishable from nondeterministic (random) keys**. Because the derivation function is a one-way function, the child key cannot be used to find the parent key. The child key also cannot be used to find any siblings. If you have the nth child, you cannot find its siblings, such as the n–1 child or the n+1 child, or any other children that are part of the sequence. Only the parent key and chain code can derive all the children. Without the child chain code, the child key cannot be used to derive any grandchildren either. You need both the child private key and the child chain code to start a new branch and derive grandchildren.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So what can the child private key be used for on its own?**<br> It can be used to make a public key and a bitcoin address. Then, it can be used to sign transactions to spend anything paid to that address.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A child private key, the corresponding public key, and the bitcoin address are all indistinguishable from keys and addresses created randomly. The fact that they are part of a sequence is not visible outside of the HD wallet function that created them. Once created, they operate exactly as \"normal\" keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extended keys\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, the key derivation function can be used to create children at any level of the tree, based on the three inputs: a key, a chain code, and the index of the desired child. The two essential ingredients are the key and chain code, and combined these are called an extended key. The term \"extended key\" could also be thought of as **\"extensible key\"** because such a key can be used to derive children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended keys are stored and represented simply as the concatenation of the 256-bit key and 256-bit chain code into a 512-bit sequence. There are two types of extended keys:\n",
    "- An **extended private key** is the combination of a private key and chain code and can be used to derive child private keys (and from them, child public keys). \n",
    "- An **extended public key** is a public key and chain code, which can be used to create child public keys (public only) as described in the next section (Public child key derivation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an extended key as the root of a branch in the tree structure of the HD wallet. With the root of the branch, you can derive the rest of the branch. The extended private key can create a complete branch, whereas the extended public key can only create a branch of public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    ">An extended key consists of a private or public key and chain code. An extended key can create children, generating its own branch in the tree structure. Sharing an extended key gives access to the entire branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended keys are encoded using Base58Check, to easily export and import between different BIP-32 compatible wallets. The Base58Check coding for extended keys uses a special version number that results in the prefix `xprv` and `xpub` when encoded in Base58 characters to make them easily recognizable. Because the extended key is 512 or 513 bits, it is also much longer than other Base58Check-encoded strings we have seen previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of an extended private key, encoded in Base58Check:\n",
    "`xprv9tyUQV64JT5qs3RSTJkXCWKMyUgoQp7F3hA1xzG6ZGu6u6Q9VMNjGr67Lctvy5P8oyaYAL9CAWrUE9i6GoNMKUga5biW6Hx4tws2six3b9c` \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the corresponding extended public key, encoded in Base58Check:\n",
    "`xpub67xpozcx8pe95XVuZLHXZeG6XWXHpGq6Qv5cmNfi7cS5mtjJ2tgypeQbBs2UAR6KECeeMVKZBPLrtJunSDMstweyLXhRgPxdp14sk9tJPW9`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public child key derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, a very useful characteristic of HD wallets is the ability to derive public child keys from public parent keys, without having the private keys. This gives us two ways to derive a child public key: either from the child private key, or directly from the parent public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **extended public key can be used, therefore, to derive all of the public keys (and only the public keys) in that branch of the HD wallet structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**This shortcut can be used to create very secure public key-only deployments where a server or application has a copy of an extended public key and no private keys whatsoever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public keys and bitcoin addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those addresses. Meanwhile, on another, more secure server, the extended private key can derive all the corresponding private keys to sign transactions and spend the money.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One common application of this solution is to install an extended public key on a web server that serves an ecommerce application. The web server can use the public key derivation function to create a new bitcoin address for every transaction (e.g., for a customer shopping cart). The web server will not have any private keys that would be vulnerable to theft. Without HD wallets, the only way to do this is to generate thousands of bitcoin addresses on a separate secure server and then preload them on the ecommerce server. That approach is cumbersome and requires constant maintenance to ensure that the ecommerce server doesn’t \"run out\" of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common application of this solution is for cold-storage or hardware wallets. In that scenario, the extended private key can be stored on a paper wallet or hardware device (such as a Trezor hardware wallet), while the extended public key can be kept online. The user can create \"receive\" addresses at will, while the private keys are safely stored offline. To spend the funds, the user can use the extended private key on an offline signing bitcoin client or sign transactions on the hardware wallet device (e.g., Trezor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following illustrates the mechanism for extending a parent public key to derive child public keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ExtendingParentPubKey.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using an Extended Public Key on a Web Store\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how HD wallets are used by continuing our story with Gabriel’s web store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel first set up his web store as a hobby, based on a simple hosted Wordpress page. His store was quite basic with only a few pages and an order form with a single bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel used the first bitcoin address generated by his Trezor device as the main bitcoin address for his store. This way, all incoming payments would be paid to an address controlled by his Trezor hardware wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers would submit an order using the form and send payment to Gabriel’s published bitcoin address, triggering an email with the order details for Gabriel to process. With just a few orders each week, this system worked well enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the little web store became quite successful and attracted many orders from the local community. Soon, Gabriel was overwhelmed. With all the orders paying the same address, it became difficult to correctly match orders and transactions, especially when multiple orders for the same amount came in close together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel’s HD wallet offers a much better solution through the ability to derive public child keys without knowing the private keys. **Gabriel can load an extended public key (xpub) on his website, which can be used to derive a unique address for every customer order. Gabriel can spend the funds from his Trezor, but the xpub loaded on the website can only generate addresses and receive funds**. This feature of HD wallets is a great security feature. Gabriel’s website does not contain any private keys and therefore does not need high levels of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export the xpub, Gabriel uses the web-based software in conjunction with the Trezor hardware wallet. The Trezor device must be plugged in for the public keys to be exported. Note that hardware wallets will never export private keys—those always remain on the device. Following shows the web interface Gabriel uses to export the xpub from Trezor hardware wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ExportxpubFromTrezor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel copies the xpub to his web store’s bitcoin shop software. He uses Mycelium Gear, which is an open source web-store plugin for a variety of web hosting and content platforms. Mycelium Gear uses the xpub to generate a unique address for every purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardened child key derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem:<br>\n",
    "The ability to derive a branch of public keys from an xpub is very useful, but it comes with a potential risk. Access to an xpub does not give access to child private keys. However, **because the xpub contains the chain code, if a child private key is known, or somehow leaked, it can be used with the chain code to derive all the other child private keys. A single leaked child private key, together with a parent chain code, reveals all the private keys of all the children**. Worse, the child private key together with a parent chain code can be used to deduce the parent private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:<br>\n",
    "To counter this risk, HD wallets use an **alternative derivation function called hardened derivation, which \"breaks\" the relationship between parent public key and child chain code**. The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a \"firewall\" in the parent/child sequence, with a chain code that cannot be used to compromise a parent or sibling private key. **The hardened derivation function looks almost identical to the normal child private key derivation, except that the parent private key is used as input to the hash function, instead of the parent public key**, as shown in the diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HardenedDerivation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the hardened private derivation function is used, the resulting child private key and chain code are completely different from what would result from the normal derivation function. **The resulting \"branch\" of keys can be used to produce extended public keys that are not vulnerable, because the chain code they contain cannot be exploited to reveal any private keys. Hardened derivation is therefore used to create a \"gap\" in the tree above the level where extended public keys are used**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing:\n",
    ">In simple terms, if you want to use the convenience of an xpub to derive branches of public keys, without exposing yourself to the risk of a leaked chain code, **you should derive it from a hardened parent, rather than a normal parent. As a best practice, the level-1 children of the master keys are always derived through the hardened derivation, to prevent compromise of the master keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index numbers for normal and hardened derivation\n",
    "The index number used in the derivation function is a 32-bit integer. To easily distinguish between keys derived through the normal derivation function versus keys derived through hardened derivation, this index number is split into two ranges. **Index numbers between 0 and $2^{31}$ – 1 (0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF) are used only for normal derivation. Index numbers between $2^{31}$ and $2^{32}$ - 1 (0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF) are used only for hardened derivation**. Therefore, if the index number is less than $2^{31}$, the child is normal, whereas if the index number is equal or above $2^{31}$, the child is hardened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make the index number easier to read and display, the index number for hardened children is displayed starting from zero, but with a prime symbol**. The first normal child key is therefore displayed as 0, whereas the first hardened child (index 0x80000000) is displayed as 0&#x27;. In sequence then, the second hardened key would have index 0x80000001 and would be displayed as 1&#x27;, and so on. When you see an HD wallet index i&#x27;, that means $2^{31}$+i.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HD wallet key identifier (path)\n",
    "Keys in an HD wallet are identified using a \"path\" naming convention, with each level of the tree separated by a slash (/) character (see HD wallet path examples). Private keys derived from the master private key start with \"m.\" Public keys derived from the master public key start with \"M.\" Therefore, the first child private key of the master private key is m/0. The first child public key is M/0. The second grandchild of the first child is m/0/1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**The \"ancestry\" of a key is read from right to left, until you reach the master key from which it was derived**.<br>\n",
    "For example, identifier m/x/y/z describes the key that is the z-th child of key m/x/y, which is the y-th child of key m/x, which is the x-th child of m.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HDWalletPathEx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Navigating the HD wallet tree structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The HD wallet tree structure offers tremendous flexibility. Each parent extended key can have 4 billion children: 2 billion normal children and 2 billion hardened children. Each of those children can have another 4 billion children, and so on. The tree can be as deep as you want, with an infinite number of generations. With all that flexibility, however, it becomes quite difficult to navigate this infinite tree. **It is especially difficult to transfer HD wallets between implementations, because the possibilities for internal organization into branches and subbranches are endless.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two BIPs, BIP-43 and BIP-44, offer a solution to this complexity by creating some proposed standards for the structure of HD wallet trees**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-43 proposes the use of the first hardened child index as a special identifier that signifies the \"purpose\" of the tree structure**. Based on BIP-43, an HD wallet should use only one level-1 branch of the tree, with the index number identifying the structure and namespace of the rest of the tree by defining its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an HD wallet using only branch m/i&#x27;/ is intended to signify a specific purpose and that purpose is identified by index number \"i\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extending that specification, BIP-44 proposes a multi-account structure as \"purpose\" number 44' under BIP-43**. All HD wallets following the BIP-44 structure are identified by the fact that they only used one branch of the tree: m/44'/.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-44 specifies the structure as consisting of five predefined tree levels:<br>\n",
    "`m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **first-level \"purpose\"** is always set to 44' signifying **multi-currency/multi-account structure**. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **second-level \"coin_type\" specifies the type of cryptocurrency coin**, allowing for multicurrency HD wallets where each currency has its own subtree under the second level. There are three currencies defined for now: Bitcoin is m/44'/0', Bitcoin Testnet is m/44&#x27;/1&#x27;, and Litecoin is m/44&#x27;/2&#x27;. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **third level of the tree is \"account,\" which allows users to subdivide their wallets into separate logical subaccounts**, for accounting or organizational purposes. For example, an HD wallet might contain two bitcoin \"accounts\": m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27; and m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/1&#x27;. Each account is the root of its own subtree. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the **fourth level, \"change,\" an HD wallet has two subtrees, one for creating receiving addresses and one for creating change addresses**. Note that whereas the previous levels used hardened derivation, this level uses normal derivation. This is to allow this level of the tree to export extended public keys for use in a nonsecured environment.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- Usable addresses are derived by the HD wallet as children of the fourth level, making the **fifth level of the tree the \"address_index\"**. This is the level from where we start generating keys in order to derive addresses. For example, the third receiving address for bitcoin payments in the primary account would be M/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27;/0/2. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions are the most important part of the bitcoin system**. Everything else in bitcoin is designed to ensure that transactions can be created, propagated on the network, validated, and finally added to the global ledger of transactions (the blockchain). \n",
    ">**Transactions are data structures that encode the transfer of value between participants in the bitcoin system**. **Each transaction is a public entry in bitcoin’s blockchain, the global double-entry bookkeeping ledger**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will examine all the various forms of transactions, what they contain, how to create them, how they are verified, and how they become part of the permanent record of all transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When we use the term \"wallet\" in this section, we are referring to the software that constructs transactions, not just the database of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transactions in Detail\n",
    "In [How Bitcoin Works](#How-Bitcoin-Works) under Buying a cup of Coffee, we looked at the transaction Alice used to pay for coffee at Bob’s coffee shop using a block explorer (Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe).\n",
    "\n",
    "The block explorer application shows a transaction from Alice’s \"address\" to Bob’s \"address.\" This is a much simplified view of what is contained in a transaction. In fact, as we will see in this section, much of the information shown is constructed by the block explorer and is not actually in the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Alice2BobTransac.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as a bitcoin search engine, in that it allows you to search for addresses, transactions, and blocks and see the relationships and flows between them. Ex: [BlockCypher Explorer](https://live.blockcypher.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transactions—Behind the Scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, an actual transaction looks very different from a transaction provided by a typical block explorer. **In fact, most of the high-level constructs, such as senders/recipients address, balances, coins etc., that we see in the various bitcoin application user interfaces do not actually exist in the bitcoin system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Bitcoin Core’s command-line interface (getrawtransaction and decoderawtransaction) to retrieve Alice’s \"raw\" transaction, decode it, and see what it contains. The result looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s transaction decoded:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AliceTransacDecoded.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice a few things about this transaction, mostly the things that are missing!<br> \n",
    "**Where is Alice’s address? Where is Bob’s address? Where is the 0.1 input \"sent\" by Alice?** <br>\n",
    ">In bitcoin system, there are **no coins, no senders, no recipients, no balances, no accounts, and no addresses**. All those things are constructed at a higher level for the benefit of the user, to make things easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also notice a lot of strange and indecipherable fields and hexadecimal strings. Don’t worry, we will explain each field shown here in detail in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction Outputs and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fundamental building block of a bitcoin transaction is a transaction output**. Transaction outputs are indivisible chunks of bitcoin currency, recorded on the blockchain, and recognized as valid by the entire network. **Bitcoin full nodes track all available and spendable outputs, known as unspent transaction outputs, or UTXO. The collection of all UTXO is known as the UTXO set** and currently numbers in the millions of UTXO. The UTXO set grows as new UTXO is created and shrinks when UTXO is consumed. **Every transaction represents a change (state transition) in the UTXO set.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When we say that a user’s wallet has \"received\" bitcoin, what we mean is that the wallet has detected an UTXO that can be spent with one of the keys controlled by that walle**t. Thus, a user’s bitcoin \"balance\" is the sum of all UTXO that user’s wallet can spend and which may be scattered among hundreds of transactions and hundreds of blocks. The concept of a balance is created by the wallet application. **The wallet calculates the user’s balance by scanning the blockchain and aggregating the value of any UTXO the wallet can spend with the keys it controls. Most wallets maintain a database or use a database service to store a quick reference set of all the UTXO they can spend with the keys they control**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction output can have an arbitrary (integer) value denominated as a multiple of satoshis. Just as dollars can be divided down to two decimal places as cents, bitcoin can be divided down to eight decimal places as satoshis. **Although an output can have any arbitrary value, once created it is indivisible. This is an important characteristic of outputs that needs to be emphasized: outputs are discrete and indivisible units of value, denominated in integer satoshis. An unspent output can only be consumed in its entirety by a transaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If an UTXO is larger than the desired value of a transaction, it must still be consumed in its entirety and change must be generated in the transaction. In other words, if you have an UTXO worth 20 bitcoin and want to pay only 1 bitcoin, your transaction must consume the entire 20-bitcoin UTXO and produce two outputs: one paying 1 bitcoin to your desired recipient and another paying 19 bitcoin in change back to your wallet. As a result of the indivisible nature of transaction outputs, most bitcoin transactions will have to generate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a shopper buying a $\\$$1.50 beverage, reaching into her wallet and trying to find a combination of coins and bank notes to cover the $\\$$1.50 cost. The shopper will choose exact change if available e.g. a dollar bill and two quarters (a quarter is $\\$$0.25), or a combination of smaller denominations (six quarters), or if necessary, a larger unit such as a $\\$$5 note. If she hands too much money, say $\\$$5, to the shop owner, she will expect $\\$$3.50 change, which she will return to her wallet and have available for future transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, **a bitcoin transaction must be created from a user’s UTXO in whatever denominations that user has available. Users cannot cut an UTXO in half any more than they can cut a dollar bill in half and use it as currency**. The user’s wallet application will typically select from the user’s available UTXO to compose an amount greater than or equal to the desired transaction amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with real life, the bitcoin application can use several strategies to satisfy the purchase amount: combining several smaller units, finding exact change, or using a single unit larger than the transaction value and making change. All of this complex assembly of spendable UTXO is done by the user’s wallet automatically and is invisible to users. It is only relevant if you are programmatically constructing raw transactions from UTXO.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A transaction consumes previously recorded unspent transaction outputs and creates new transaction outputs that can be consumed by a future transaction**. This way, chunks of bitcoin value move forward from owner to owner in a chain of transactions consuming and creating UTXO.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **It is this UTXO that people, generally, refer to as Bitcoin**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception to the output and input chain is a special type of transaction called the **coinbase transaction, which is the first transaction in each block. This transaction is placed there by the \"winning\" miner and creates brand-new bitcoin payable to that miner as a reward for mining. This special coinbase transaction does not consume UTXO**; instead, it has a special type of input called the **\"coinbase.\"** This is how bitcoin’s money supply is created during the mining process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What comes first? Inputs or outputs**, the chicken or the egg?<br> \n",
    "Strictly speaking, **outputs come first because coinbase transactions, which generate new bitcoin, have no inputs and create outputs from nothing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Every bitcoin transaction creates outputs, which are recorded on the bitcoin ledger. **Almost all of these outputs, with one exception create spendable chunks of bitcoin called UTXO**, which are then recognized by the whole network and available for the owner to spend in a future transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTXO are tracked by every full-node bitcoin client in the UTXO set. **New transactions consume (spend) one or more of these outputs from the UTXO set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction outputs consist of two parts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **amount/value of bitcoin**, denominated in satoshis, the smallest bitcoin unit\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **cryptographic puzzle** that determines the conditions required to spend the output. The cryptographic puzzle is also known as a **locking script, a witness script, or a scriptPubKey**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transaction scripting language, used in the locking script mentioned previously, is discussed in detail in Transaction Scripts and Script Language section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s look at Alice’s transaction (shown previously in Transactions—Behind the Scenes) and see if we can identify the outputs. **In the JSON encoding, the outputs are in an array (list) named vout**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AliceTransactionJSON.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the transaction contains two outputs. Each output is defined by a value and a cryptographic puzzle. In the encoding shown by Bitcoin Core, the value is shown in bitcoin, but in the transaction itself it is recorded as an integer denominated in satoshis. The second part of each output is the cryptographic puzzle that sets the conditions for spending. Bitcoin Core shows this as scriptPubKey and shows us a human-readable representation of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of locking and unlocking UTXO will be discussed later, in Script Construction (Lock + Unlock). The scripting language that is used for the script in scriptPubKey is discussed in Transaction Scripts and Script Language. But before we delve into those topics, we need to understand the overall structure of transaction inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction serialization—outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "When transactions are transmitted over the network or exchanged between applications, they are serialized. Serialization is the process of converting the internal representation of a data structure into a format that can be transmitted one byte at a time, also known as a byte stream. **Serialization is most commonly used for encoding data structures for transmission over a network or for storage in a file**. The serialization format of a transaction output is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransactionOutputSerialize.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most bitcoin libraries and frameworks do not store transactions internally as byte-streams, as that would require complex parsing every time you needed to access a single field. For convenience and readability, bitcoin libraries store transactions internally in data structures (usually object-oriented structures).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The process of converting from the byte-stream representation of a transaction to a library’s internal representation data structure is called deserialization or transaction parsing**. The process of converting back to a byte-stream for transmission over the network, for hashing, or for storage on disk is called serialization. Most bitcoin libraries have built-in functions for transaction serialization and deserialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can manually decode Alice’s transaction from the serialized hexadecimal form, finding some of the elements we saw previously. The section containing the two outputs is highlighted in Alice’s transaction, serialized and presented in hexadecimal notation to help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Alice’s transaction shown under [Transactions—Behind the Scenes](#Transactions—Behind-the-Scenes), serialized and presented in hexadecimal notation (contains input, which we will discover later in Example 2, followed by output):\n",
    "\n",
    "0100000001186f9f998a5aa6f048e51dd8419a14d8a0f1a8a2836dd73 4d2804fe65fa35779000000008b483045022100884d142d86652a3f47 ba4746ec719bbfbd040a570b1deccbb6498c75c4ae24cb02204b9f039 ff08df09cbe9f6addac960298cad530a863ea8f53982c09db8f6e3813 01410484ecc0d46f1918b30928fa0e4ed99f16a0fb4fde0735e7ade84 16ab9fe423cc5412336376789d172787ec3457eee41c04f4938de5cc1 7b4a10fa336a8d752adfffffffff02**60e31600000000001976a914ab6 8025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e788acd0ef800000000000 1976a9147f9b1a7fb68d60c536c2fd8aeaa53a8f3cc025a888ac**00000000\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two outputs in the highlighted section, each serialized as shown in Transaction output serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value of 0.015 bitcoin is 1,500,000 satoshis. That’s 16 e3 60 in hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the serialized transaction, the value 16 e3 60 is encoded in little-endian (least-significant-byte-first) byte order, so it looks like 60 e3 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scriptPubKey length is 25 bytes, which is 19 in hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction inputs identify (by reference) which UTXO will be consumed and provide proof of ownership through an unlocking script.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a transaction, a wallet selects from the UTXO it controls, UTXO with enough value to make the requested payment. Sometimes one UTXO is enough, other times more than one is needed. For each UTXO that will be consumed to make this payment, the wallet creates one input pointing to the UTXO and unlocks it with an unlocking script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the components of an input in greater detail:\n",
    "- The **first part of an input is a pointer to an UTXO by reference to the transaction hash and an output index**, which identifies the specific UTXO in that transaction.\n",
    "- The **second part is an unlocking script**, which the wallet constructs in order to satisfy the spending conditions set in the UTXO. **Most often, the unlocking script is a digital signature and public key proving ownership of the bitcoin**. However, not all unlocking scripts contain signatures. \n",
    "- The **third part is a sequence number**, which will be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our example in Transactions—Behind the Scenes. **The transaction inputs are an array (list) called vin**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransactionInpInAliceTransac.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there is only one input in the list (because one UTXO contained sufficient value to make this payment). The input contains four elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **transaction ID** (txid), referencing the transaction that contains the UTXO being spent\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **output index** (vout), identifying which UTXO from that transaction is referenced (first one is zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **scriptSig**, also referred to as unlocking script, a which satisfies the conditions placed on the UTXO (in its locking-script/scriptPubKey), unlocking it for spending\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **sequence number** (to be discussed later)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Alice’s transaction, the input points to the transaction ID:\n",
    "`7957a35fe64f80d234d76d83a2a8f1a0d8149a41d81de548f0a65a8a999f6f18`<br>\n",
    "and output index 0 (i.e., the first UTXO created by that transaction). \n",
    ">**The unlocking script is constructed by Alice’s wallet by**:\n",
    "- first retrieving the referenced UTXO\n",
    "- examining its locking script (also referred as scriptPubKey/cryptographic-puzzle)\n",
    "- then using it to build the necessary unlocking-script/scriptSig to satisfy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fetching the UTXO for Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking just at the input you may have noticed that we don’t know anything about this UTXO, other than a reference to the transaction containing it. **We don’t know its value (amount in satoshi), and we don’t know the locking script that sets the conditions for spending it**. To find this information, **we must retrieve the referenced UTXO by retrieving the underlying transaction**. Notice that because the value of the input is not explicitly stated, we must also use the referenced UTXO in order to calculate the fees that will be paid in this transaction (see Transaction Fees).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It’s not just Alice’s wallet that needs to retrieve UTXO referenced in the inputs. Once this transaction is broadcast to the network, every validating node will also need to retrieve the UTXO referenced in the transaction inputs in order to validate the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions on their own seem incomplete because they lack context**. They reference UTXO in their inputs but without retrieving that UTXO we cannot know the value of the inputs or their locking conditions. When writing bitcoin software, anytime you decode a transaction with the intent of validating it or counting the fees or checking the unlocking script, your code will first have to retrieve the referenced UTXO from the blockchain in order to build the context implied but not present in the UTXO references of the inputs. For example, to calculate the amount paid in fees, you must know the sum of the values of inputs and outputs. But without retrieving the UTXO referenced in the inputs, you do not know their value. So a seemingly simple operation like counting fees in a single transaction in fact involves multiple steps and data from multiple transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same sequence of commands with Bitcoin Core as we used when retrieving Alice’s transaction (getrawtransaction and decoderawtransaction). With that we can get the UTXO referenced in the input and take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s UTXO from the previous transaction (when she exchanged 0.10 BTC for 10 USD from her friend Joe, if you remember), referenced in the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Alice'sUTXOFromPrevTransec.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that this UTXO has a value of 0.1 BTC and that it has a locking script (scriptPubKey) that contains \"OP_DUP OP_HASH160…\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: To fully understand Alice’s present transaction we had to retrieve the previous transaction(s) referenced in/as inputs. A function that retrieves previous transactions and unspent transaction outputs is very common and exists in almost every bitcoin library and API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction serialization—inputs\n",
    "When transactions are serialized for transmission on the network, their inputs are encoded into a byte stream as shown below:\n",

    "### Transaction Fees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most transactions include transaction fees, which compensate the bitcoin miners for securing the network. Fees also serve as a security mechanism themselves, by making it economically infeasible for attackers to flood the network with transactions**. Mining and the fees and rewards collected by miners would be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section examines how transaction fees are included in a typical transaction. **Most wallets calculate and include transaction fees automatically**. However, if you are constructing transactions programmatically, or using a command-line interface, you must manually account for and include these fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction fees serve as an incentive to include (mine) a transaction into the next block and also as a disincentive against abuse of the system by imposing a small cost on every transaction**. Transaction fees are collected by the miner who mines the block that records the transaction on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction fees are calculated based on the size of the transaction in kilobytes, not the value of the transaction in bitcoin. Overall, transaction fees are set based on market forces within the bitcoin network**. Miners prioritize transactions based on many different criteria, including fees, and might even process transactions for free under certain circumstances. Transaction fees affect the processing priority, meaning that **a transaction with sufficient fees is likely to be included in the next block mined, whereas a transaction with insufficient or no fees might be delayed, processed on a best-effort basis after a few blocks, or not processed at all**. Transaction fees are not mandatory, and transactions without fees might be processed eventually; however, including transaction fees encourages priority processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the way transaction fees are calculated and the effect they have on transaction prioritization has evolved:\n",
    "- At first, transaction fees were fixed and constant across the network. \n",
    "- Gradually, the fee structure relaxed and may be influenced by market forces, based on network capacity and transaction volume. - Since at least the beginning of 2016, capacity limits in bitcoin have created competition between transactions, resulting in higher fees and effectively making free transactions a thing of the past. **Zero fee or very low fee transactions rarely get mined and sometimes will not even be propagated across the network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bitcoin Core, fee relay policies are set by the minrelaytxfee option. The current default minrelaytxfee is 0.00001 bitcoin or a hundredth of a millibitcoin per kilobyte. Therefore, by default, transactions with a fee less than 0.00001 bitcoin are treated as free and are only relayed if there is space in the mempool; otherwise, they are dropped. Bitcoin nodes can override the default fee relay policy by adjusting the value of minrelaytxfee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any bitcoin service that creates transactions, including wallets, exchanges, retail applications, etc., must implement dynamic fees. **Dynamic fees can be implemented through a third-party fee estimation service or with a built-in fee estimation algorithm**. If you’re unsure, begin with a third-party service and as you gain experience design and implement your own algorithm if you wish to remove the third-party dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fee estimation algorithms calculate the appropriate fee, based on capacity and the fees offered by \"competing\" transactions.** These algorithms range from simplistic (average or median fee in the last block) to sophisticated (statistical analysis). They estimate the necessary fee (in satoshis per byte) that will give a transaction a high probability of being selected and included within a certain number of blocks. Most services offer users the option of choosing high, medium, or low priority fees. **High priority means users pay higher fees but the transaction is likely to be included in the next block. Medium and low priority means users pay lower transaction fees but the transactions may take much longer to confirm.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many wallet applications use third-party services for fee calculations. One popular service is http://bitcoinfees.21.co, which provides an API and a visual chart showing the fee in satoshi/byte for different priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Static fees are no longer viable on the bitcoin network. **Wallets that set static fees will produce a poor user experience as transactions will often get \"stuck\" and remain unconfirmed**. Users who don’t understand bitcoin transactions and fees are dismayed by \"stuck\" transactions because they think they’ve lost their money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart below, Fee estimation service by bitcoinfees.21.co, shows the real-time estimate of fees in 10 satoshi/byte increments and the expected confirmation time (in minutes and number of blocks) for transactions with fees in each range. For each fee range (e.g., 61–70 satoshi/byte), two horizontal bars show the number of unconfirmed transactions (1405) and total number of transactions in the past 24 hours (102,975), with fees in that range. Based on the graph, the recommended high-priority fee at this time was 80 satoshi/byte, a fee likely to result in the transaction being mined in the very next block (zero block delay). For perspective, the median transaction size is 226 bytes, so the recommended fee for a transaction size would be 18,080 satoshis (0.00018080 BTC).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Feeestimationservice.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The fee estimation data can be retrieved via a simple HTTP REST API, at https://bitcoinfees.21.co/api/v1/fees/recommended. For example, on the command line using the curl command:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/FeeEstimationAPI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The API returns a JSON object with the current fee estimate for fastest confirmation (fastestFee), confirmation within three blocks (halfHourFee) and six blocks (hourFee), in satoshi per byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Fees to Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure of transactions does not have a field for fees. Instead, fees are implied as the difference between the sum of inputs and the sum of outputs. Any excess amount that remains after all outputs have been deducted from all inputs is the fee that is collected by the miners:\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction fees are implied, as the excess of inputs minus outputs:<br>\n",
    "`Fees = Sum(Inputs) – Sum(Outputs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a somewhat confusing element of transactions and an important point to understand, because **if you are constructing your own transactions you must ensure you do not inadvertently include a very large fee by underspending the inputs**. That means that you must account for all inputs, if necessary by creating change, or you will end up giving the miners a very big tip!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, **if you consume a 20-bitcoin UTXO to make a 1-bitcoin payment, you must include a 19-bitcoin change output back to your wallet (this is when we are constructing our own transaction as a developer, else the present wallets will automatically handle the change and fee issue). Otherwise, the 19-bitcoin \"leftover\" will be counted as a transaction fee and will be collected by the miner who mines your transaction in a block**. Although you will receive priority processing and make a miner very happy, this is probably not what you intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: \n",
    ">If you forget to add a change output in a manually constructed transaction, you will be paying the change as a transaction fee. \"Keep the change!\" might not be what you intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Alice Coffee Purchase<br>\n",
    "Let’s see how this works in practice, by looking at Alice’s coffee purchase again. Alice wants to spend 0.015 bitcoin to pay for coffee. To ensure this transaction is processed promptly, she will want to include a transaction fee, say 0.001. That will mean that the total cost of the transaction will be 0.016. Her wallet must therefore source a set of UTXO that adds up to 0.016 bitcoin or more and, if necessary, create change. Let’s say her wallet has a 0.2-bitcoin UTXO available. It will therefore need to consume this UTXO, create one output to Bob’s Cafe for 0.015, and a second output with 0.184 bitcoin in change back to her own wallet, leaving 0.001 bitcoin unallocated, as an implicit fee for the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Eugenia, Children's Charity director<br>\n",
    "Now let’s look at a different scenario. Eugenia, our children’s charity director in the Philippines, has completed a fundraiser to purchase schoolbooks for the children. She received several thousand small donations from people all around the world, totaling 50 bitcoin, so her wallet is full of very small payments (UTXO). Now she wants to purchase hundreds of schoolbooks from a local publisher, paying in bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Eugenia’s wallet application tries to construct a single larger payment transaction, it must source from the available UTXO set, which is composed of many smaller amounts. That means that the resulting transaction will source from more than a hundred small-value UTXO as inputs and only one output, paying the book publisher. A transaction with that many inputs will be larger than one kilobyte, perhaps several kilobytes in size. As a result, it will require a much higher fee than the median-sized transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eugenia’s wallet application will calculate the appropriate fee by measuring the size of the transaction and multiplying that by the per-kilobyte fee. Many wallets will overpay fees for larger transactions to ensure the transaction is processed promptly. The higher fee is not because Eugenia is spending more money, but because her transaction is more complex and larger in size, the fee is independent of the transaction’s bitcoin value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight:\n",
    "> **As transaction fees are calculated based on the size of the transaction in kilobytes, not the value of the transaction in bitcoin.** Therefore, it might seem preferable to have, where ever possible, a one large bitcoin payment rather than multiple small payment. As at the time of spending, for a single large UTXO, the size of the transaction, in kilobytes, would be low leading to low transaction fee. Whereas many small UTXO that add up to a large value, would naturally mean that the size of transaction would be large and hence would incur more transaction fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction Scripts and Script Language\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin transaction script language, called Script, is a Forth-like reverse-polish notation stack-based execution language. If that sounds like gibberish, you probably haven’t studied 1960s programming languages, but that’s ok—we will explain it all in this section. Both the locking script placed on an UTXO and the unlocking script are written in this scripting language. **When a transaction is validated, the unlocking script in each input is executed alongside the corresponding UTXO's locking script to see if it satisfies the spending condition.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Script is a very simple language that was designed to be limited in scope and executable on a range of hardware, perhaps as simple as an embedded device**. It requires minimal processing and cannot do many of the fancy things modern programming languages can do. For its use in validating programmable money, this is a deliberate security feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most transactions processed through the bitcoin network have the form \"Payment to Bob’s bitcoin address\" and are based on a script called a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash script. However, bitcoin transactions are not limited to the \"Payment to Bob’s bitcoin address\" script. In fact, locking scripts can be written to express a vast variety of complex conditions. In order to understand these more complex scripts, we must first understand the basics of transaction scripts and script language.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Bitcoin transaction validation is not based on a static pattern, but instead is achieved through the execution of a scripting language**. This language allows for a nearly infinite variety of conditions to be expressed. This is how bitcoin gets the power of \"programmable money.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will demonstrate the basic components of the bitcoin transaction scripting language and show how it can be used to express simple conditions for spending and how those conditions can be satisfied by unlocking scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turing Incompleteness\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin transaction script language contains many operators, but is deliberately limited in one important way—**there are no loops or complex flow control capabilities other than conditional flow control. This ensures that the language is not Turing Complete, meaning that scripts have limited complexity and predictable execution times**. Script is not a general-purpose language. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These limitations ensure that the language cannot be used to create an infinite loop or other form of \"logic bomb\" that could be embedded in a transaction in a way that causes a denial-of-service attack against the bitcoin network**. Remember, every transaction is validated by every full node on the bitcoin network. A limited language prevents the transaction validation mechanism from being used as a vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateless Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "**The bitcoin transaction script language is stateless, in that there is no state prior to execution of the script, or state saved after execution of the script**. Therefore, all the information needed to execute a script is contained within the script. **A script will predictably execute the same way on any system**. If your system verifies a script, you can be sure that every other system in the bitcoin network will also verify the script, meaning that a valid transaction is valid for everyone and everyone knows this. This predictability of outcomes is an essential benefit of the bitcoin system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Construction (Lock + Unlock)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin’s transaction validation engine relies on two types of scripts to validate transactions**: \n",
    "- a locking script, and \n",
    "- an unlocking script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locking Script:<br> \n",
    "**A locking script is a spending condition placed on an output: it specifies the conditions that must be met to spend the output in the future. Historically, the locking script was called a scriptPubKey, because it usually contained a public key or bitcoin address (public key hash)**. In this notebook we refer to it as a \"locking script\" to acknowledge the much broader range of possibilities of this scripting technology. **In most bitcoin applications, what we refer to as a locking script will appear in the source code as scriptPubKey**. You will also see the locking script referred to as a witness script or more generally as a cryptographic puzzle. These terms all mean the same thing, at different levels of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlocking Script:<br>\n",
    "**An unlocking script is a script that \"solves,\" or satisfies, the conditions placed on an output by a locking script and allows the output to be spent. Unlocking scripts are part of every transaction input. Most of the time they contain a digital signature produced by the user’s wallet from his or her private key**. Historically, the unlocking script was called **scriptSig**, because it usually contained a digital signature. In most bitcoin applications, the source code refers to the unlocking script as scriptSig. You will also see the unlocking script referred to as a witness. In this notebook, we refer to it as an \"unlocking script\" to acknowledge the much broader range of locking script requirements, because not all unlocking scripts must contain signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction Validation:<br>\n",
    "Every bitcoin validating node will validate transactions by executing the locking and unlocking scripts together. Each input contains an unlocking script and refers to a previously existing UTXO. **The validation software will copy the unlocking script, retrieve the UTXO referenced by the input, and copy the locking script from that UTXO. The unlocking and locking script are then executed in sequence (which was modified to separate execution due to a vulnerability, explained later).** The input is valid if the unlocking script satisfies the locking script conditions (see Separate execution of unlocking and locking scripts). All the inputs are validated independently, as part of the overall validation of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the UTXO is permanently recorded in the blockchain, and therefore is invariable and is unaffected by failed attempts to spend it by reference in a new transaction. Only a valid transaction that correctly satisfies the conditions of the output results in the output being considered as \"spent\" and removed from the set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following image is an example of the unlocking and locking scripts for the most common type of bitcoin transaction (a payment to a public key hash), showing the combined script resulting from the concatenation of the unlocking and locking scripts prior to script validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Combiningscripts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The script execution stack\n",
    "**Bitcoin’s scripting language is called a stack-based language because it uses a data structure called a stack**. A stack is a very simple data structure that can be visualized as a stack of cards. A stack allows two operations: push and pop. Push adds an item on top of the stack. Pop removes the top item from the stack. Operations on a stack can only act on the topmost item on the stack. A stack data structure is also called a Last-In-First-Out, or \"LIFO\" queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The scripting language executes the script by processing each item from left to right. Numbers (data constants) are pushed onto the stack. Operators push or pop one or more parameters from the stack, act on them, and might push a result onto the stack.** For example, OP_ADD will pop two items from the stack, add them, and push the resulting sum onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional operators evaluate a condition, producing a boolean result of TRUE or FALSE**. For example, OP_EQUAL pops two items from the stack and pushes TRUE (TRUE is represented by the number 1) if they are equal or FALSE (represented by zero) if they are not equal. **Bitcoin transaction scripts usually contain a conditional operator, so that they can produce the TRUE result that signifies a valid transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice: Bitcoin's script uses stack with post-order processing/traversal mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A simple script\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s apply what we’ve learned about scripts and stacks to some simple examples for understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bitcoin’s script validation doing simple math, the script `2 3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL` demonstrates the arithmetic addition operator `OP_ADD`, adding two numbers and putting the result on the stack, followed by the conditional operator `OP_EQUAL`, which checks that the resulting sum is equal to 5. For brevity, the OP_ prefix is omitted in the step-by-step example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although most locking scripts refer to a public key hash (essentially, a bitcoin address), thereby requiring proof of ownership to spend the funds, the script does not have to be that complex.** Any combination of locking and unlocking scripts that results in a TRUE value is valid. The simple arithmetic we used as an example of the scripting language is also a valid locking script that can be used to lock a transaction output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use part of the arithmetic example script as the locking script:<br>\n",
    "`3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL`\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be satisfied by a transaction containing an input with the unlocking script:<br>\n",
    "`2`\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation software combines the locking and unlocking scripts and the resulting script is:<br>\n",
    "`2 3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL`\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the step-by-step example in Bitcoin’s script validation doing simple math, when this script is executed, the result is OP_TRUE, making the transaction valid. **Not only is this a valid transaction output locking script, but the resulting UTXO could be spent by anyone with the arithmetic skills to know that the number 2 satisfies the script.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ScriptValidation-SimpleMath.png)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Transactions are valid if the top result on the stack is TRUE (noted as &#x7b;0x01&#x7d;), any other nonzero value, or if the stack is empty after script execution. Transactions are invalid if the top value on the stack is FALSE (a zero-length empty value, noted as &#x7b;&#x7d;) or if script execution is halted explicitly by an operator, such as OP_VERIFY, OP_RETURN, or a conditional terminator such as OP_ENDIF. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a slightly more complex script, which calculates `2 + 7 - 3 + 1`. Notice that when the script contains several operators in a row, the stack allows the results of one operator to be acted upon by the next operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "`2 7 OP_ADD 3 OP_SUB 1 OP_ADD 7 OP_EQUAL`<br>\n",
    "Try validating the preceding script yourself using pencil and paper. When the script execution ends, you should be left with the value TRUE on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Separate execution of unlocking and locking scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the original bitcoin client, the unlocking and locking scripts were concatenated and executed in sequence (both script are put together in sequence and with the help of a single stack, as shown in simple script example above, validation was performed).** For security reasons, this was changed in 2010, because of a vulnerability that allowed a malformed unlocking script to push data onto the stack and corrupt the locking script. **In the current implementation, the scripts are executed separately with the stack transferred between the two executions**, as described:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, the unlocking script is executed, using the stack execution engine. If the unlocking script is executed without errors (e.g., it has no \"dangling\" operators left over), the main stack is copied and the locking script is executed. <br><br>\n",
    "- If the result of executing the locking script with the stack data copied from the unlocking script is \"TRUE,\" the unlocking script has succeeded in resolving the conditions imposed by the locking script and, therefore, the input is a valid authorization to spend the UTXO. <br><br>\n",
    "- **If any result other than \"TRUE\" remains after execution of the combined script, the input is invalid because it has failed to satisfy the spending conditions placed on the UTXO**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH)\n",
    "Note: Public key hash is nothing but the address without the Base58Check encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of transactions processed on the bitcoin network spend outputs locked with a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash or \"P2PKH\" script. **These outputs contain a locking script that locks the output to a public key hash, more commonly known as a bitcoin address. An output locked by a P2PKH script can be unlocked (spent) by presenting a public key and a digital signature created by the corresponding private key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s look at Alice’s payment to Bob’s Cafe again. Alice made a payment of 0.015 bitcoin to the cafe’s bitcoin address. That transaction output would have a locking script of the form:<br>\n",
    "`OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <Cafe Public Key Hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cafe Public Key Hash is equivalent to the bitcoin address of the cafe, without the Base58Check encoding. Most applications would show the public key hash in hexadecimal encoding and not the familiar bitcoin address Base58Check format that begins with a \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding locking script can be satisfied with an unlocking script of the form:<br>\n",
    "`<Cafe Signature> <Cafe Public Key>`\n",
    "\n",

    "`<Cafe Signature> <Cafe Public Key> OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <Cafe Public Key Hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "**When executed, this combined script will evaluate to TRUE if, and only if, the unlocking script matches the conditions set by the locking script**. In other words, the result will be TRUE if the unlocking script has a valid signature from the cafe’s private key that corresponds to the public key hash set as an encumbrance.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section we look at how digital signatures work and **how they can present proof of ownership of a private key without revealing that private key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital signature algorithm used in bitcoin is the **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA**. ECDSA is the algorithm used for digital signatures based on elliptic curve private/public key pairs. ECDSA is used by the script functions `OP_CHECKSIG`, `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY`, `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`, and `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY`. **Any time you see those in a locking script, the unlocking script must contain an ECDSA signature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital signature serves three purposes in bitcoin:\n",
    "- First, the signature proves that the owner of the private key, who is by implication the owner of the funds, has **authorized the spending of those funds**. \n",
    "- Secondly, the proof of authorization is undeniable (**nonrepudiation**). \n",
    "- Thirdly, the signature proves that **the transaction (or specific parts of the transaction) have not and cannot be modified by anyone after it has been signed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that each transaction input is signed independently**. This is critical, as neither the signatures nor the inputs have to belong to or be applied by the same \"owners.\" In fact, a specific transaction scheme called **\"CoinJoin\"** uses this fact to create multi-party transactions for privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Each transaction input and any signature it may contain is completely independent of any other input or signature**. Multiple parties can collaborate to construct transactions and sign only one input each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia’s Definition of a \"Digital Signature\"<br>\n",
    "A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or documents. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (nonrepudiation), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Digital Signatures Work\n",
    "A digital signature is a mathematical scheme that consists of two parts:\n",
    "- The first part is an algorithm for creating a signature, using a private key (the signing key), from a message (the transaction) called the **Signing Algorithm**. \n",
    "- The second part is an algorithm that allows anyone to verify the signature given the message and a public key known as **Verification Algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a digital signature\n",
    "In bitcoin’s implementation of the ECDSA algorithm, **the \"message\" being signed is the transaction, or more accurately a hash of a specific subset of the data in the transaction** (see Signature Hash Types (SIGHASH)). The signing key is the user’s private key. The result is the signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Sig = F_{sig}(F_{hash}(m), dA)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:<br>\n",
    "dA is the signing private key<br>\n",
    "m is the transaction (or parts of it)<br>\n",
    "Fhash is the hashing function<br>\n",
    "Fsig is the signing algorithm<br>\n",
    "Sig is the resulting signature\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, **the signing algorithm takes the message, hash it and encrypts the hash using the private key.** More details on the mathematics of ECDSA can be found in ECDSA Math section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The function Fsig produces a signature Sig that is composed of two values, commonly referred to as R and S: `Sig = (R, S)`**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Verifying the Signature\n",
    "To verify the signature, one must have the signature (R and S), the serialized transaction, and the public key (that corresponds to the private key used to create the signature). Essentially, verification of a signature means \"Only the owner of the private key that generated this public key could have produced this signature on this transaction\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "The signature verification algorithm **takes the message (a hash of the transaction or parts of it), the signer’s public key and the signature (R and S values), and returns TRUE if the signature is valid for this message and public key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signature Hash Types (SIGHASH)\n",
    "Digital signatures are applied to messages, which in the case of bitcoin, are the transactions themselves. The signature implies a commitment by the signer to specific transaction data. **In the simplest form, the signature applies to the entire transaction, thereby committing all the inputs, outputs, and other transaction fields. However, a signature can commit to only a subset of the data in a transaction**, which is useful for a number of scenarios as we will see in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin signatures have a way of indicating which part of a transaction’s data is included in the hash signed by the private key using a SIGHASH flag. The SIGHASH flag is a single byte that is appended to the signature**. Every signature has a SIGHASH flag and the flag can be different from input to input. A transaction with three signed inputs may have three signatures with different SIGHASH flags, each signature signing (committing) different parts of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, each input may contain a signature in its unlocking script. As a result, a transaction that contains several inputs may have signatures with different SIGHASH flags that commit different parts of the transactions. Note also that bitcoin transactions may contain inputs from different \"owners,\" who may sign only one input in a partially constructed (and invalid) transaction, collaborating with others to gather all the necessary signatures to make a valid transaction. **Many of the SIGHASH flag types only make sense if you think of multiple participants collaborating outside the bitcoin network and updating a partially signed transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three SIGHASH flags: **ALL, NONE**, and **SINGLE**, as shown\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/SIGHHASHtypes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is a modifier flag **SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY**, which can be combined with each of the preceding flags. **When ANYONECANPAY is set, only one input is signed, leaving the rest (and their sequence numbers) open for modification**. The ANYONECANPAY has the value 0x80 and is applied by bitwise OR, resulting in the combined flags as shown\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/SIGHHASHtypesWithModifiers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The way SIGHASH flags are applied during signing and verification is that a copy of the transaction is made and certain fields within are truncated (set to zero length and emptied). The resulting transaction is serialized. The SIGHASH flag is added to the end of the serialized transaction and the result is hashed. The hash itself is the \"message\" that is signed. Depending on which SIGHASH flag is used, different parts of the transaction are truncated. The resulting hash depends on different subsets of the data in the transaction. By including the SIGHASH as the last step before hashing, the signature commits the SIGHASH type as well, so it can’t be changed (e.g., by a miner).\n",
    "\n",
    ">SIGHASH types sign the transaction nLocktime field. In addition, the SIGHASH type itself is appended to the transaction before it is signed, so that it can’t be modified once signed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of Alice’s transaction (see the list in Serialization of signatures (DER)), we saw that **the last part of the DER-encoded signature was 01, which is the SIGHASH_ALL flag. This locks the transaction data, so Alice’s signature is committing the state of all inputs and outputs. This is the most common signature form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at some of the other SIGHASH types and how they can be used in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ALL|ANYONECANPAY<br>\n",
    "This construction can be used to make a \"crowdfunding”-style transaction. Someone attempting to raise funds can construct a transaction with a single output. The single output pays the \"goal\" amount to the fundraiser. Such a transaction is obviously not valid, as it has no inputs. However, others can now amend it by adding an input of their own, as a donation. They sign their own input with ALL|ANYONECANPAY. Unless enough inputs are gathered to reach the value of the output, the transaction is invalid. Each donation is a \"pledge,\" which cannot be collected by the fundraiser until the entire goal amount is raised.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- NONE<br>\n",
    "This construction can be used to create a \"bearer check\" or \"blank check\" of a specific amount. It commits to the input, but allows the output locking script to be changed. Anyone can write their own bitcoin address into the output locking script and redeem the transaction. However, the output value itself is locked by the signature.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- NONE|ANYONECANPAY<br>\n",
    "This construction can be used to build a \"dust collector.\" Users who have tiny UTXO in their wallets can’t spend these without the cost in fees exceeding the value of the dust. With this type of signature, the dust UTXO can be donated for anyone to aggregate and spend whenever they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some proposals to modify or expand the SIGHASH system. One such proposal is Bitmask Sighash Modes by Blockstream’s Glenn Willen, as part of the Elements project. This aims to create a flexible replacement for SIGHASH types that allows \"arbitrary, miner-rewritable bitmasks of inputs and outputs\" that can express \"more complex contractual precommitment schemes, such as signed offers with change in a distributed asset exchange.\"\n",
    "\n",
    ">**You will not see SIGHASH flags presented as an option in a user’s wallet application. With few exceptions, wallets construct P2PKH scripts and sign it with a Signature having SIGHASH_ALL flags**. To use a different SIGHASH flag, you would have to write software to construct and sign transactions. More importantly, SIGHASH flags can be used by special-purpose bitcoin applications that enable novel uses.\n",

From k, we generate the corresponding temporary public key P (calculated as P = k*G, in the same way bitcoin public keys are derived). The R value of the digital signature is then the x coordinate of the ephemeral public key P.\n",

    "#### The Importance of Randomness in Signatures\n",
    "As we saw in ECDSA Math, the signature generation algorithm uses a random key k, as the basis for an ephemeral private/public key pair. The value of k is not important, as long as it is random. **If the same value k is used to produce two signatures on different messages (transactions), then the signing private key can be calculated by anyone**, that is, reuse of the same value for k in a signature algorithm leads to exposure of the private key!\n",

We have seen this issue lead to exposure of private keys in a few different implementations of transaction-signing algorithms in bitcoin. **People have had funds stolen because of inadvertent reuse of a k value. The most common reason for reuse of a k value is an improperly initialized random-number generator.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To avoid this vulnerability, the industry best practice is to not generate k with a random-number generator seeded with entropy, but instead to use a deterministic-random process seeded with the transaction data itself**. This ensures that each transaction produces a different k. The industry-standard algorithm for deterministic initialization of k is defined in [RFC 6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979), published by the Internet Engineering Task Force.\n",

    "## Bitcoin Addresses, Balances, and Other Abstractions\n",
    "\n",
    "We began this chapter with the discovery that transactions look very different \"behind the scenes\" than how they are presented in wallets, blockchain explorers, and other user-facing applications. Many of the simplistic and familiar concepts from the earlier chapters, such as bitcoin addresses and balances, seem to be absent from the transaction structure. We saw that transactions don’t contain bitcoin addresses, per se, but instead operate through scripts that lock and unlock discrete values of bitcoin. Balances are not present anywhere in this system and yet every wallet application prominently displays the balance of the user’s wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now that we have explored what is actually included in a bitcoin transaction, we can examine how the higher-level abstractions are derived from the seemingly primitive components of the transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look again at how Alice’s transaction was presented on a popular block explorer [View Transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/0627052b6f28912f2703066a912ea577f2ce4da4caa5a5fbd8a57286c345c2f2):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AliceTransac2Bob.png)\n",
    "Note: Bitcoin works via creating outputs and spending from outputs. **When you create an output and no transaction (next transaction) has spent from it, then it is an unspent output aka UTXO** (which is why unspent is written in green). **If there is a transaction which has spend from the output, then it is a spent output**(spent would be written in red). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the left side of the transaction, the blockchain explorer shows Alice’s bitcoin address as the \"sender.\" In fact, this information is not in the transaction itself. **When the blockchain explorer retrieved the transaction it also retrieved the previous transaction referenced in the input and extracted the first output from that older transaction. Within that output is a locking script that locks the UTXO to Alice’s public key hash (a P2PKH script). The blockchain explorer extracted the public key hash and encoded it using Base58Check encoding to produce and display the bitcoin address that represents that public key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, on the right side, the blockchain explorer shows the two outputs; the first to Bob’s bitcoin address and the second to Alice’s bitcoin address (as change). Once again, **to create these bitcoin addresses, the blockchain explorer extracted the locking script from each output, recognized it as a P2PKH script, and extracted the public-key-hash from within. Finally, the blockchain explorer reencoded that public key hash with Base58Check to produce and display the bitcoin addresses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to click on Bob’s bitcoin address, the blockchain explorer would show you the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BalOfBob'sAddress.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "The blockchain explorer displays the balance of Bob’s bitcoin address. But nowhere in the bitcoin system is there a concept of a \"balance.\" Rather, the values displayed here are constructed by the blockchain explorer as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the **\"Total Received\"** amount, the blockchain explorer first will decode the Base58Check encoding of the bitcoin address to retrieve the 160-bit hash of Bob’s public key that is encoded within the address. **Then, the blockchain explorer will search through the database of transactions, looking for outputs with P2PKH locking scripts that contain Bob’s public key hash. By summing up the value of all the outputs, the blockchain explorer can produce the total value received.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constructing the current balance (displayed as \"Final Balance\") requires a bit more work**. The blockchain explorer keeps a separate database of the outputs that are currently unspent, the UTXO set. **To maintain this database, the blockchain explorer must monitor the bitcoin network, add newly created UTXO, and remove spent UTXO, in real time, as they appear in unconfirmed transactions**. This is a complicated process that depends on keeping track of transactions as they propagate, as well as maintaining consensus with the bitcoin network to ensure that the correct chain is followed. **Sometimes, the blockchain explorer goes out of sync and its perspective of the UTXO set is incomplete or incorrect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the UTXO set, the blockchain explorer sums up the value of all unspent outputs referencing Bob’s public key hash and produces the \"Final Balance\" number shown to the user.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to produce this one image, with these two \"balances,\" the blockchain explorer has to index and search through dozens, hundreds, or even hundreds of thousands of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing:\n",
    ">**The information presented to users through wallet applications, blockchain explorers, and other bitcoin user interfaces is often composed of higher-level abstractions that are derived by searching many different transactions, inspecting their content, and manipulating the data contained within them**. By presenting this simplistic view of bitcoin transactions that resemble bank checks from one sender to one recipient, these applications have to abstract a lot of underlying detail. They mostly focus on the common types of transactions: P2PKH with SIGHASH_ALL signatures on every input. Thus, while bitcoin applications can present more than 80% of all transactions in an easy-to-read manner, they are sometimes stumped by transactions that deviate from the norm. Transactions that contain more complex locking scripts, or different SIGHASH flags, or many inputs and outputs, demonstrate the simplicity and weakness of these abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, hundreds of transactions that do not contain P2PKH outputs are confirmed on the blockchain. The blockchain explorers often present these with red warning messages saying they cannot decode an address. The following link contains the most recent \"strange transactions\" that were not fully decoded: [Strange Transactions](https://blockchain.info/strange-transactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in the next section, these are not necessarily strange transactions. They are transactions that contain more complex locking scripts than the common P2PKH. We will learn how to decode and understand more complex scripts and the applications they support next.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, **we introduced the basic elements of bitcoin transactions and looked at the most common type of transaction script, the P2PKH script. In this section we will look at more advanced scripting** and how we can use it to build transactions with complex conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will look at **multisignature scripts**. Next, we will examine the second most common transaction script, **Pay-to-Script-Hash**, which opens up a whole world of complex scripts. Then, we will examine new script operators that add a time dimension to bitcoin, through **timelocks**. Finally, we will look at Segregated Witness, an architectural change to the structure of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multisignature\n",
    "\n",
    "Multisignature scripts set a condition where N public keys are recorded in the script and at least M of those must provide signatures to unlock the funds. **This is also known as an M-of-N scheme, where N is the total number of keys and M is the threshold of signatures required for validation**. For example, a 2-of-3 multisignature is one where three public keys are listed as potential signers and at least two of those must be used to create signatures for a valid transaction to spend the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, standard multisignature scripts are limited to at most 3 listed public keys, meaning you can do anything from a 1-of-1 to a 3-of-3 multisignature or any combination within that range. The limitation to 3 listed keys might be lifted by the time this book is published, so check the IsStandard() function to see what is currently accepted by the network. **Note that the limit of 3 keys applies only to standard (also known as \"bare\") multisignature scripts, not to multisignature scripts wrapped in a Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) script**. P2SH multisignature scripts are limited to 15 keys, allowing for up to 15-of-15 multisignature. We will learn about P2SH in Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of a locking script setting an M-of-N multisignature condition is:<br>\n",
    "`M <Public Key 1> <Public Key 2> ... <Public Key N> N CHECKMULTISIG`<br>\n",
    "where N is the total number of listed public keys and M is the threshold of required signatures to spend the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A locking script setting a 2-of-3 multisignature condition looks like this:<br>\n",
    "`2 <Public Key A> <Public Key B> <Public Key C> 3 CHECKMULTISIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding locking script can be satisfied with an unlocking script containing pairs of signatures and public keys:<br>\n",
    "`<Signature B> <Signature C>`<br>\n",
    "or any combination of two signatures from the private keys corresponding to the three listed public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two scripts together would form the combined validation script:<br>\n",
    "`<Signature B> <Signature C> 2 <Public Key A> <Public Key B> <Public Key C> 3 CHECKMULTISIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "When executed, this combined script will evaluate to TRUE if, and only if, the unlocking script matches the conditions set by the locking script. In this case, **the condition is whether the unlocking script has a valid signature from the two private keys that correspond to two of the three public keys set as an encumbrance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A bug in CHECKMULTISIG execution\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a bug in CHECKMULTISIG's execution that requires a slight workaround. When CHECKMULTISIG executes, it should consume M+N+2 items on the stack as parameters. However, due to the bug, CHECKMULTISIG will pop an extra value or one value more than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at this in greater detail using the previous validation example:<br>\n",
    "`<Signature B> <Signature C> 2 <Public Key A> <Public Key B> <Public Key C> 3 CHECKMULTISIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "First, CHECKMULTISIG pops the top item, which is N (in this example \"3\"). Then it pops N items, which are the public keys that can sign. In this example, public keys A, B, and C. Then, it pops one item, which is M, the quorum (how many signatures are needed). Here M = 2. At this point, CHECKMULTISIG should pop the final M items, which are the signatures, and see if they are valid. However, **unfortunately, a bug in the implementation causes CHECKMULTISIG to pop one more item (M+1 total) than it should. The extra item is disregarded when checking the signatures so it has no direct effect on CHECKMULTISIG itself. However, an extra value must be present because if it is not present, when CHECKMULTISIG attempts to pop on an empty stack, it will cause a stack error and script failure (marking the transaction as invalid). Because the extra item is disregarded it can be anything, but customarily 0 is used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this bug became part of the consensus rules, it must now be replicated forever. Therefore the correct script validation would look like this:\n",
    "`0 <Signature B> <Signature C> 2 <Public Key A> <Public Key B> <Public Key C> 3 CHECKMULTISIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the unlocking script actually used in multisig is not:<br>\n",
    "`<Signature B> <Signature C>`\n",
    "\n",
    "but instead it is:<br>\n",
    "`0 <Signature B> <Signature C>`\n",
    "    \n",
    "From now on, if you see a multisig unlocking script, you should expect to see an extra 0 in the beginning, whose only purpose is as a workaround to a bug that accidentally became a consensus rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)\n",
    "Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) was introduced in 2012 as a powerful new type of transaction that greatly simplifies the use of complex transaction scripts. To explain the need for P2SH, let’s look at a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories) we introduced Mohammed, an electronics importer based in Dubai. Mohammed’s company uses bitcoin’s multisignature feature extensively for its corporate accounts. Multisignature scripts are one of the most common uses of bitcoin’s advanced scripting capabilities and are a very powerful feature. Mohammed’s company uses a multisignature script for all customer payments, known in accounting terms as \"accounts receivable,\" or AR. With the multisignature scheme, any payments made by customers are locked in such a way that they require at least two signatures to release, from Mohammed and one of his partners or from his attorney who has a backup key. A multisignature scheme like that offers corporate governance controls and protects against theft, embezzlement, or loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting script is quite long and looks like this:<br>\n",
    "`2 <Mohammed's Public Key> <Partner1 Public Key> <Partner2 Public Key> <Partner3 Public Key> <Attorney Public Key> 5CHECKMULTISIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem with complex locking scripts:**<br>\n",
    "Although multisignature scripts are a powerful feature, they are cumbersome to use. Given the preceding script, Mohammed would have to communicate this script to every customer prior to payment. Each customer would have to use special bitcoin wallet software with the ability to create custom transaction scripts, and each customer would have to understand how to create a transaction using custom scripts. Furthermore, the resulting transaction would be about five times larger than a simple payment transaction, because this script contains very long public keys. The burden of that extra-large transaction would be borne by the customer in the form of fees. Finally, a large transaction script like this would be carried in the UTXO set in RAM in every full node, until it was spent. All of these issues make using complex locking scripts difficult in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "P2SH was developed to resolve these practical difficulties and to make the use of complex scripts as easy as a payment to a bitcoin address. With P2SH payments, **the complex locking script is replaced with its digital fingerprint, a cryptographic hash. When a transaction attempting to spend the UTXO is presented later, it must contain the script that matches the hash, in addition to the unlocking script. In simple terms, P2SH means \"pay to a script matching this hash, a script that will be presented later when this output is spent\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "In P2SH transactions, the locking script that is replaced by a hash is referred to as the **redeem script** because it is **presented to the system at redemption time rather than as a locking script**. Table 1 shows the script without P2SH and Table 2 shows the same script encoded with P2SH.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Complexscriptwith-outP2SH.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the tables, with P2SH the complex script that details the conditions for spending the output (redeem script) is not presented in the locking script. Instead, **only a hash of it is in the locking script and the redeem script itself is presented later, as part of the unlocking script when the output is spent. This shifts the burden in fees and complexity from the sender to the recipient (spender) of the transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at Mohammed’s company, the complex multisignature script, and the resulting P2SH scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the multisignature script that Mohammed’s company uses for all incoming payments from customers:<br>\n",
    "`2 <Mohammed's Public Key> <Partner1 Public Key> <Partner2 Public Key> <Partner3 Public Key> <Attorney Public Key> 5 CHECKMULTISIG`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "P2SH addresses hide all of the complexity, so that the person making a payment does not see the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of P2SH\n",
    "The P2SH feature offers the following benefits compared to the direct use of complex scripts in locking outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex scripts are replaced by **shorter fingerprints in the transaction output, making the transaction smaller**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scripts can be coded as an address**, so the sender and the sender’s wallet don’t need complex engineering to implement P2SH.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- P2SH **shifts the burden of constructing the script to the recipient**, not the sender.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- P2SH shifts the burden in data storage for the long script from the output (which additionally to being stored on the blockchain is in the UTXO set) to the input (only stored on the blockchain).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- P2SH **shifts the burden in data storage for the long script from the present time (payment) to a future time (when it is spent)**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- P2SH **shifts the transaction fee cost of a long script from the sender to the recipient**, who has to include the long redeem script to spend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redeem Script and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to version 0.9.2 of the Bitcoin Core client, **Pay-to-Script-Hash was limited to the standard types of bitcoin transaction scripts**, by the IsStandard() function. That means that the redeem script presented in the spending transaction could only be one of the standard types: **P2PK(Pay 2 Public Key), P2PKH(Pay 2 Public Key Hash), or multisig (Multi-Signature)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of version 0.9.2 of the Bitcoin Core client, **P2SH transactions can contain any valid script, making the P2SH standard much more flexible and allowing for experimentation with many novel and complex types of transactions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not able to put a P2SH inside a P2SH redeem script, because the P2SH specification is not recursive. Also, while it is technically possible to include RETURN (see Data Recording Output (RETURN)) in a redeem script, as nothing in the rules prevents you from doing so, **it is of no practical use because executing RETURN during validation will cause the transaction to be marked invalid.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because the redeem script is not presented to the network until you attempt to spend a P2SH output, if you lock an output with the hash of an invalid redeem script it will be processed regardless. The UTXO will be successfully locked. However, you will not be able to spend it because the spending transaction, which includes the redeem script, will not be accepted because it is an invalid script. **This creates a risk, because you can lock bitcoin in a P2SH that cannot be spent later. The network will accept the P2SH locking script even if it corresponds to an invalid redeem script, because the script hash gives no indication of the script it represents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning:\n",
    "> P2SH locking scripts contain the hash of a redeem script, which gives no clues as to the content of the redeem script itself. The P2SH transaction will be considered valid and accepted even if the redeem script is invalid. You might accidentally lock bitcoin in such a way that it cannot later be spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Recording Output (RETURN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin’s distributed and timestamped ledger, the blockchain, has potential uses far beyond payments. **Many developers have tried to use the transaction scripting language to take advantage of the security and resilience of the system for applications such as digital notary services, stock certificates, and smart contracts**. Early attempts to use bitcoin’s script language for these purposes involved creating transaction outputs that recorded data on the blockchain; for example, to record a digital fingerprint of a file in such a way that anyone could establish proof-of-existence of that file on a specific date by reference to that transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The use of bitcoin’s blockchain to store data unrelated to bitcoin payments is a controversial subject**. Many developers consider such use abusive and want to discourage it. Others view it as a demonstration of the powerful capabilities of blockchain technology and want to encourage such experimentation. Those who object to the inclusion of nonpayment data argue that it causes **\"blockchain bloat,\"** burdening those running full bitcoin nodes with carrying the cost of disk storage for data that the blockchain was not intended to carry. Moreover, **such transactions create UTXO that cannot be spent, using the destination bitcoin address as a freeform 20-byte field. Because the address is used for data, it doesn’t correspond to a private key and the resulting UTXO can never be spent; it’s a fake payment. These transactions that can never be spent are therefore never removed from the UTXO set and cause the size of the UTXO database to forever increase, or \"bloat.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "In version 0.9 of the Bitcoin Core client, a compromise was reached with the introduction of the RETURN operator. **RETURN allows developers to add 80 bytes of nonpayment data to a transaction output. However, unlike the use of \"fake\" UTXO, the RETURN operator creates an explicitly \"provably unspendable output\", which does not need to be stored in the UTXO set**. RETURN outputs are recorded on the blockchain, so they consume disk space and contribute to the increase in the blockchain’s size, but they are not stored in the UTXO set and therefore do not bloat the UTXO memory pool and burden full nodes with the cost of more expensive RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "RETURN scripts look like this:<br>\n",
    "`RETURN <data>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The data portion is limited to 80 bytes and most often represents a hash, such as the output from the SHA256 algorithm (32 bytes). **Many applications put a prefix in front of the data to help identify the application. For example, the [Proof of Existence](http://proofofexistence.com/) digital notarization service uses the 8-byte prefix DOCPROOF**, which is ASCII encoded as 44 4f 43 50 52 4f 4f 46 in hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep in mind that there is no \"unlocking script\" that corresponds to RETURN that could possibly be used to \"spend\" a RETURN output**. The whole point of RETURN is that you can’t spend the money locked in that output, and therefore it does not need to be held in the UTXO set as potentially spendable—RETURN is provably unspendable. **RETURN is usually an output with a zero bitcoin amount, because any bitcoin assigned to such an output is effectively lost forever. If a RETURN is referenced as an input in a transaction, the script validation engine will halt the execution of the validation script and mark the transaction as invalid**. The execution of RETURN essentially causes the script to \"RETURN\" with a FALSE and halt. Thus, if you accidentally reference a RETURN output as an input in a transaction, that transaction is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard transaction (one that conforms to the IsStandard() checks) can have only one RETURN output. However, a single RETURN output can be combined in a transaction with outputs of any other type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two new command-line options have been added in Bitcoin Core as of version 0.10. The option `datacarrier` controls relay and mining of RETURN transactions, with the default set to \"1\" to allow them. The option `datacarriersize` takes a numeric argument specifying the maximum size in bytes of the RETURN script, 83 bytes by default, which, allows for a maximum of 80 bytes of RETURN data plus one byte of RETURN opcode and two bytes of PUSHDATA opcode.\n",
    "\n",
    ">RETURN was initially proposed with a limit of 80 bytes, but the limit was reduced to 40 bytes when the feature was released. In February 2015, in version 0.10 of Bitcoin Core, the limit was raised back to 80 bytes. **Nodes may choose not to relay or mine RETURN, or only relay and mine RETURN containing less than 80 bytes of data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timelocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timelocks are restrictions on transactions or outputs that only allow spending after a point in time**. Bitcoin has had a **transaction-level timelock feature** from the beginning. **It is implemented by the nLocktime field in a transaction**. Two new timelock features were introduced in late 2015 and mid-2016 that offer **UTXO-level timelocks**. These are `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` and `CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timelocks are useful for postdating transactions and locking funds to a date in the future. More importantly, **timelocks extend bitcoin scripting into the dimension of time, opening the door for complex multistep smart contracts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Locktime (nLocktime)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the beginning, bitcoin has had a transaction-level timelock feature. **Transaction locktime is a transaction-level setting (a field in the transaction data structure) that defines the earliest time that a transaction is valid and can be relayed on the network or added to the blockchain**. Locktime is also known as `nLocktime` from the variable name used in the Bitcoin Core codebase. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is set to zero in most transactions to indicate immediate propagation and execution. **If nLocktime is nonzero and below 500 million, it is interpreted as a block height, meaning the transaction is not valid and is not relayed or included in the blockchain prior to the specified block height. If it is above 500 million, it is interpreted as a Unix Epoch timestamp (seconds since Jan-1-1970) and the transaction is not valid prior to the specified time**. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Transactions with nLocktime specifying a future block or time must be held by the originating system and transmitted to the bitcoin network only after they become valid. **If a transaction is transmitted to the network before the specified nLocktime, the transaction will be rejected by the first node as invalid and will not be relayed to other nodes**. The use of nLocktime is equivalent to postdating a paper check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction locktime limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**nLocktime has the limitation that while it makes it possible to spend some outputs in the future, it does not make it impossible to spend them until that time**. Let’s explain that with the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice signs a transaction spending one of her outputs to Bob’s address, and sets the transaction nLocktime to 3 months in the future. Alice sends that transaction to Bob to hold. With this transaction Alice and Bob know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bob cannot transmit the transaction to redeem the funds until 3 months have elapsed.\n",
    "- Bob may transmit the transaction after 3 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alice can create another transaction, double-spending the same inputs without a locktime.** Thus, Alice can spend the same UTXO before the 3 months have elapsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bob has no guarantee that Alice won’t do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the limitations of transaction nLocktime. **The only guarantee is that Bob will not be able to redeem it before 3 months have elapsed. There is no guarantee that Bob will get the funds. To achieve such a guarantee, the timelock restriction must be placed on the UTXO itself and be part of the locking script, rather than on the transaction.** This is achieved by the next form of timelock, called Check Lock Time Verify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check Lock Time Verify (CLTV)\n",
    "In December 2015, a new form of timelock was introduced to bitcoin as a soft fork upgrade. Based on a specification in BIP-65, a new script operator called `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` (CLTV) was added to the scripting language. CLTV is a per-output timelock, rather than a per-transaction timelock as is the case with nLocktime. This allows for much greater flexibility in the way timelocks are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, **by adding the CLTV opcode in the redeem script of an output it restricts the output, so that it can only be spent after the specified time has elapsed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: While **nLocktime is a transaction-level timelock, CLTV is an output-based/UTXO timelock**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">CLTV doesn’t replace nLocktime, but rather restricts specific UTXO such that they can only be spent in a future transaction with nLocktime set to a greater or equal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLTV opcode takes one parameter as input, expressed as a number in the same format as nLocktime (either a block height or Unix epoch time). As indicated by the VERIFY suffix, CLTV is the type of opcode that halts execution of the script if the outcome is FALSE. If it results in TRUE, execution continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to lock an output with CLTV, you insert it into the redeem script of the output in the transaction that creates the output. For example, if Alice is paying Bob’s address, the output would normally contain a P2PKH script like this:<br>\n",
    "`DUP HASH160 <Bob's Public Key Hash> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "To lock it to a time, say 3 months from now, the transaction would be a P2SH transaction with a redeem script like this: <br>\n",
    "`<now + 3 months> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP DUP HASH160 <Bob's Public Key Hash> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "where <now {plus} 3 months> is a block height or time value estimated 3 months from the time the transaction is mined: current block height + 12,960 (blocks) or current Unix epoch time + 7,760,000 (seconds). For now, don’t worry about the `DROP` opcode that follows `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`; it will be explained shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Bob tries to spend this UTXO, he constructs a transaction that references the UTXO as an input. **He uses his signature and public key in the unlocking script of that input and sets the transaction nLocktime to be equal or greater to the timelock in the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY Alice set**. Bob then broadcasts the transaction on the bitcoin network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s transaction is evaluated as follows:\n",
    "- If the `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` parameter Alice set is less than or equal the spending transaction’s nLocktime, script execution continues (acts as if a “no operation” or NOP opcode was executed). \n",
    "- Otherwise, script execution halts and the transaction is deemed invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY fails and halts execution, marking the transaction invalid if (source: BIP-65):\n",
    "\n",
    "- the stack is empty; or\n",
    "- the top item on the stack is less than 0; or\n",
    "- the lock-time type (height versus timestamp) of the top stack item and the nLocktime field are not the same; or\n",
    "- the top stack item is greater than the transaction’s nLocktime field; or\n",
    "- the nSequence field of the input is 0xffffffff.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **CLTV and nLocktime use the same format to describe timelocks**, either a block height or the time elapsed in seconds since Unix epoch. Critically, when used together, the format of nLocktime must match that of CLTV in the outputs—they must both reference either block height or time in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "After execution, **if CLTV is satisfied, the time parameter that preceded it remains as the top item on the stack and may need to be dropped, with DROP, for correct execution of subsequent script opcodes**. You will often see `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` followed by `DROP` in scripts for this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**By using nLocktime in conjunction with CLTV, the scenario described in [Transaction locktime limitations](#Transaction-locktime-limitations) changes. Alice can no longer spend the money (because it’s locked with Bob’s key) and Bob cannot spend it before the 3-month locktime has expired.**\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing timelock functionality directly into the scripting language, CLTV allows us to develop some very interesting complex scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard is defined in **BIP-65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative Timelocks\n",
    "\n",
    "nLocktime and CLTV are both absolute timelocks in that they specify an absolute point in time. The next two timelock features we will examine are relative timelocks in that they specify, as a condition of spending an output, an elapsed time from the confirmation of the output in the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relative timelocks are useful because they allow a chain of two or more inter-dependent transactions to be held off chain, while imposing a time constraint on one transaction that is dependent on the elapsed time from the confirmation of a previous transaction. In other words, the clock doesn’t start counting until the UTXO is recorded on the blockchain**. This functionality is especially useful in bidirectional state channels and Lightning Networks, as we will see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative timelocks, like absolute timelocks, are implemented with both a transaction-level feature and a script-level opcode.\n",
    "- The **transaction-level relative timelock is implemented as a consensus rule on the value of `nSequence`**, a transaction field that is set in every transaction input. \n",
    "- **Script-level relative timelocks are implemented with the `CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` (CSV)** opcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative timelocks are implemented according to the specifications in [BIP-68, Relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) and [BIP-112, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki).\n",

    "#### Relative Timelocks with nSequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative timelocks can be set on each input of a transaction, by setting the nSequence field in each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Original meaning of nSequence\n",
    "The nSequence field was originally intended (but never properly implemented) to allow modification of transactions in the mempool. In that use, **a transaction containing inputs with nSequence value below $2^{32}$ - 1 (0xFFFFFFFF) indicated a transaction that was not yet \"finalized.\" Such a transaction would be held in the mempool until it was replaced by another transaction spending the same inputs with a higher nSequence value**. Once a transaction was received whose inputs had an nSequence value of 0xFFFFFFFF it would be considered \"finalized\" and mined.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The original meaning of nSequence was never properly implemented and the value of nSequence is customarily set to 0xFFFFFFFF in transactions that do not utilize timelocks. For transactions with nLocktime or CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, **the nSequence value must be set to less than $2^{31}$ for the timelock guards to have an effect, as explained below**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### nSequence as a consensus-enforced relative timelock\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the activation of BIP-68, new consensus rules apply for any transaction containing an input whose nSequence value is less than $2^{31}$. Programmatically, that means:\n",
    "- **If the most significant bit($32^{th}$ bit or $31^{st}$ in power index of 2) is not set, it is a flag that means \"relative locktime\"**. \n",
    "- Otherwise, the nSequence value is reserved for other uses such as enabling CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, nLocktime, Opt-In-Replace-By-Fee, and other future developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction inputs with nSequence values less than $2^{31}$ are interpreted as having a relative timelock. Such a transaction is only valid once the input has aged by the relative timelock amount.** For example, a transaction with one input with an nSequence relative timelock of 30 blocks is only valid when at least 30 blocks have elapsed from the time the UTXO referenced in the input was mined. Since **nSequence is a per-input field, a transaction may contain any number of timelocked inputs, all of which must have sufficiently aged for the transaction to be valid**. A transaction can include both timelocked inputs (nSequence < $2^{31}$) and inputs without a relative timelock (nSequence >= $2^{31}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The nSequence value is specified in either blocks or seconds**, but in a slightly different format than we saw used in nLocktime. A type-flag is used to differentiate between values counting blocks and values counting time in seconds. **The type-flag is set in the 23rd least-significant bit. If the type-flag is set, then the nSequence value is interpreted as a multiple of 512 seconds. If the type-flag is not set, the nSequence value is interpreted as a number of blocks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When **interpreting nSequence as a relative timelock, only the 16 least significant bits** are considered. Once the flags (bits 32 and 23) are evaluated, the nSequence value is usually \"masked\" with a 16-bit mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following shows the binary layout of the nSequence value, as defined by BIP-68:\n",
    "![](./Images/binarylayoutnSequence-BIP68.png)\n",

    "Relative timelocks based on consensus enforcement of the nSequence value are defined in BIP-68. The standard is defined in [BIP-68, Relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relative Timelocks with CSV\n",
    "**Just like CLTV and nLocktime, there is a script opcode for relative timelocks that leverages the nSequence value in scripts**. That opcode is `CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`, commonly referred to as CSV for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The CSV opcode when evaluated in an UTXO’s redeem script allows spending only in a transaction whose input nSequence value is greater than or equal to the CSV parameter**. Essentially, this restricts spending the UTXO until a certain number of blocks or seconds have elapsed relative to the time the UTXO was mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with CLTV, the value in CSV must match the format in the corresponding nSequence value. If CSV is specified in terms of blocks, then so must nSequence. If CSV is specified in terms of seconds, then so must nSequence.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Relative timelocks with CSV are especially useful when several (chained) transactions are created and signed, but not propagated, when they’re kept \"off-chain.\" **A child transaction cannot be used until the parent transaction has been propagated, mined, and aged by the time specified in the relative timelock**.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is defined in detail in [BIP-112, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Median-Time-Past\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the activation of relative timelocks, there was also a change in the way \"time\" is calculated for timelocks (both absolute and relative). **In bitcoin there is a subtle, but very significant, difference between wall time and consensus time**. Bitcoin is a decentralized network, which means that each participant has his or her own perspective of time. Events on the network do not occur instantaneously everywhere. **Network latency must be factored into the perspective of each node. Eventually everything is synchronized to create a common ledger**. Bitcoin reaches consensus every 10 minutes about the state of the ledger as it existed in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The timestamps set in block headers are set by the miners**. There is a certain degree of latitude allowed by the consensus rules to account for differences in clock accuracy between decentralized nodes. However, **this creates an unfortunate incentive for miners to lie about the time in a block so as to earn extra fees by including timelocked transactions that are not yet mature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove the incentive to lie and strengthen the security of timelocks, a BIP was proposed and activated at the same time as the BIPs for relative timelocks. **This is BIP-113, which defines a new consensus measurement of time called Median-Time-Past.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Median-Time-Past, specified in BIP-113, is calculated by taking the timestamps of the last 11 blocks and finding the median**. That median time then becomes consensus time and is used for all timelock calculations. By taking the midpoint from approximately two hours in the past, the influence of any one block’s timestamp is reduced. By incorporating 11 blocks, no single miner can influence the timestamps in order to gain fees from transactions with a timelock that hasn’t yet matured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median-Time-Past changes the implementation of time calculations for nLocktime, CLTV, nSequence, and CSV. **The consensus time calculated by Median-Time-Past is always approximately one hour behind wall clock time. If you create timelock transactions, you should account for it when estimating the desired value to encode in nLocktime, nSequence, CLTV, and CSV**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timelock Defense Against Fee Sniping\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fee-sniping is a theoretical attack scenario, where miners attempting to rewrite past blocks \"snipe\" higher-fee transactions from future blocks to maximize their profitability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say the highest block in existence is block #100,000. If instead of attempting to mine block #100,001 to extend the chain, some miners attempt to remine #100,000. These miners can choose to include any valid transaction (that hasn’t been mined yet) in their candidate block #100,000. They don’t have to remine the block with the same transactions. In fact, they have the incentive to select the most profitable (highest fee per kB) transactions to include in their block. **They can include any transactions that were in the \"old\" block #100,000, as well as any transactions from the current mempool. Essentially they have the option to pull transactions from the \"present\" into the rewritten \"past\" when they re-create block #100,000.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Today, this attack is not very lucrative**, because block reward is much higher than total fees per block. But at some point in the future, transaction fees will be the majority of the reward (or even the entirety of the reward). At that time, this scenario becomes inevitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To prevent \"fee sniping,\" when Bitcoin Core creates transactions, it uses nLocktime to limit them to the \"next block,\" by default.** In our scenario, Bitcoin Core would set nLocktime to 100,001 on any transaction it created. Under normal circumstances, this nLocktime has no effect—the transactions could only be included in block #100,001 anyway; it’s the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**But under a blockchain fork attack, the miners would not be able to pull high-fee transactions from the mempool, because all those transactions would be timelocked to block #100,001.** They can only remine #100,000 with whatever transactions were valid at that time, essentially gaining no new fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, Bitcoin Core sets the nLocktime on all new transactions to `<current block # + 1>` and sets the nSequence on all the inputs to 0xFFFFFFFE ($2^{32}$ - 1, i.e, finalized transaction) to enable nLocktime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scripts with Flow Control (Conditional Clauses)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more powerful features of Bitcoin Script is flow control, also known as conditional clauses. You are probably familiar with flow control in various programming languages that use the construct IF...THEN...ELSE. **Bitcoin conditional clauses look a bit different, but are essentially the same construct.**\n",
    "\n",
    "At a basic level, **bitcoin conditional opcodes allow us to construct a redeem script that has two ways of being unlocked, depending on a TRUE/FALSE outcome of evaluating a logical condition**. For example, if x is TRUE, the redeem script is A and the ELSE redeem script is B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, **bitcoin conditional expressions can be \"nested\" indefinitely**, meaning that a conditional clause can contain another within it, which contains another, etc. Bitcoin Script flow control can be used to construct very complex scripts with hundreds or even thousands of possible execution paths. **There is no limit to nesting, but consensus rules impose a limit on the maximum size, in bytes, of a script**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin implements **flow control** using the `IF`, `ELSE`, `ENDIF`, and `NOTIF` opcodes. Additionally, conditional expressions can contain **boolean operators** such as `BOOLAND`, `BOOLOR`, and `NOT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, you may find the bitcoin’s flow control scripts confusing. That is because **Bitcoin Script is a stack language. The same way that 1 + 1 looks \"backward\" when expressed as 1 1 ADD, flow control clauses in bitcoin also look \"backward.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "In most traditional (procedural) programming languages, flow control looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/FlowControl-GeneralProgLang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a stack-based language like Bitcoin Script, the logical condition comes before the IF, which makes it look \"backward,\" like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/FlowControl-BitcoinScript.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When reading Bitcoin Script, remember that the condition being evaluated comes before the IF opcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripting Language:\n",
    "> A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports **scripts: programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Clauses with VERIFY Opcodes\n",
    "Another form of conditional in Bitcoin Script is any opcode that ends in VERIFY. The VERIFY suffix means that if the condition evaluated is not TRUE, execution of the script terminates immediately and the transaction is deemed invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike an IF clause, which offers alternative execution paths, the **VERIFY suffix acts as a guard clause**, continuing only if a precondition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following script requires Bob’s signature and a pre-image (secret) that produces a specific hash. Both conditions must be satisfied to unlock:\n",
    "\n",
    "A redeem script with an EQUALVERIFY guard clause<br>\n",
    "`HASH160 <expected hash> EQUALVERIFY <Bob's Pubkey> CHECKSIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "To redeem this, Bob must construct an unlocking script that presents a valid pre-image and a signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "An unlocking script to satisfy the above redeem script<br>\n",
    "`<Bob's Sig> <hash pre-image>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Without presenting the pre-image, Bob can’t get to the part of the script that checks for his signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script can be written with an IF instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "A redeem script with an IF guard clause\n",
    "```\n",
    "HASH160 <expected hash> EQUAL\n",
    "IF\n",
    "   <Bob's Pubkey> CHECKSIG\n",
    "ENDIF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s unlocking script is identical:\n",
    "\n",
    "An unlocking script to satisfy the above redeem script<br>\n",
    "`<Bob's Sig> <hash pre-image>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The script with IF does the same thing as using an opcode with a VERIFY suffix; they both operate as guard clauses. However, the VERIFY construction is more efficient, using two fewer opcodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **when do we use VERIFY and when do we use IF?** <br>\n",
    "If all we are trying to do is to attach a precondition (guard clause), then VERIFY is better. If, however, we want to have more than one execution path (flow control), then we need an IF...ELSE flow control clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **An opcode such as EQUAL will push the result (TRUE/FALSE) onto the stack**, leaving it there for evaluation by subsequent opcodes. In contrast, the opcode EQUALVERIFY suffix does not leave anything on the stack. **Opcodes that end in VERIFY do not leave the result on the stack.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Flow Control in Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "**A very common use for flow control in Bitcoin Script is to construct a redeem script that offers multiple execution paths, each a different way of redeeming the UTXO.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a simple example, where we have two signers, Alice and Bob, and either one is able to redeem. With multisig, this would be expressed as a 1-of-2 multisig script. For the sake of demonstration, we will do the same thing with an IF clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF\n",
    " <Alice's Pubkey> CHECKSIG\n",
    "ELSE\n",
    " <Bob's Pubkey> CHECKSIG\n",
    "ENDIF\n",
    "```\n",
    "Looking at this redeem script, you may be wondering: **\"Where is the condition? <br>\n",
    "Actually, there is nothing preceding the IF clause!**\" The condition is not part of the redeem script. Instead, **the condition will be offered in the unlocking script, allowing Alice and Bob to \"choose\" which execution path they want**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice redeems this with the unlocking script:<br>\n",
    "`<Alice's Sig> 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1 at the end serves as the condition (TRUE) that will make the IF clause execute the first redemption path for which Alice has a signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Bob to redeem this, he would have to choose the second execution path by giving a FALSE value to the IF clause:<br>\n",
    "`<Bob's Sig> 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s unlocking script puts a 0 on the stack, causing the IF clause to execute the second (ELSE) script, which requires Bob’s signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since IF clauses can be nested, we can create a \"maze\" of execution paths. The unlocking script can provide a \"map\" selecting which execution path is actually executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF\n",
    "  script A\n",
    "ELSE\n",
    "  IF\n",
    "    script B\n",
    "  ELSE\n",
    "    script C\n",
    "  ENDIF\n",
    "ENDIF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, there are three execution paths (script A, script B, and script C). **The unlocking script provides a path in the form of a sequence of TRUE or FALSE values. To select path script B, for example, the unlocking script must end in 1 0 (TRUE, FALSE). These values will be pushed onto the stack, so that the second value (FALSE) ends up at the top of the stack.** The outer IF clause pops the FALSE value and executes the first ELSE clause. Then the TRUE value moves to the top of the stack and is evaluated by the inner (nested) IF, selecting the B execution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this construct, we can build redeem scripts with tens or hundreds of execution paths, each offering a different way to redeem the UTXO. To spend, we construct an unlocking script that navigates the execution path by putting the appropriate TRUE and FALSE values on the stack at each flow control point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex Script Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we combine many of the concepts from this chapter into a single example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example uses the story of Mohammed, the company owner in Dubai who is operating an import/export business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Mohammed wishes to construct a company capital account with flexible rules. The scheme he creates requires different levels of authorization depending on timelocks. The participants in the multisig scheme are Mohammed, his two partners Saeed and Zaira, and their company lawyer Abdul. The three partners make decisions based on a majority rule, so two of the three must agree. However, in the case of a problem with their keys, they want their lawyer to be able to recover the funds with one of the three partner signatures. Finally, if all partners are unavailable or incapacitated for a while, they want the lawyer to be able to manage the account directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the redeem script that Mohammed designs to achieve this (line number prefix as XX):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/VariableMulti-SigwithTimelock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mohammed’s script implements three execution paths using nested IF...ELSE flow control clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Execution Path:** <br>\n",
    "In the first execution path, this script operates as a simple 2-of-3 multisig with the three partners. This execution path consists of lines 3 and 9. Line 3 sets the quorum of the multisig to 2 (2-of-3). This execution path can be selected by putting TRUE TRUE at the end of the unlocking script:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlocking script for the first execution path (2-of-3 multisig)<br>\n",
    "`0 <Mohammed's Sig> <Zaira's Sig> TRUE TRUE`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The 0 at the beginning of this unlocking script is because of a bug in CHECKMULTISIG that pops an extra value from the stack. The extra value is disregarded by the CHECKMULTISIG, but it must be present or the script fails. Pushing 0 (customarily) is a workaround to the bug, as described in [A bug in CHECKMULTISIG execution](#A-bug-in-CHECKMULTISIG-execution).\n",
    "\n",
    ">We do Unlocking-script + locking-script/redeem-script (both in earlier used sequence execution and now used separate execution). Therefore, we first take the unlocking script and push it into the stack while moving from left to right and therefore both the TRUE would be on the top of the stack and then we introduce the locking script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Execution Path:** <br>\n",
    "The second execution path can only be used after 30 days have elapsed from the creation of the UTXO. At that time, it requires the signature of Abdul the lawyer and one of the three partners (a 1-of-3 multisig). This is achieved by line 7, which sets the quorum for the multisig to 1. To select this execution path, the unlocking script would end in FALSE TRUE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlocking script for the second execution path (Lawyer + 1-of-3) <br>\n",
    "`0 <Saeed's Sig> <Abdul's Sig> FALSE TRUE`\n",
    "\n",
    ">Why FALSE TRUE? Isn’t that backward? Because the two values are pushed on to the stack, with FALSE pushed first, then TRUE pushed second. TRUE is therefore popped first by the first IF opcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Third Execution Path:** <br>\n",
    "Finally, the third execution path allows Abdul the lawyer to spend the funds alone, but only after 90 days. To select this execution path, the unlocking script has to end in FALSE:\n",

    "`<Abdul's Sig> FALSE`\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running the script on paper to see how it behaves on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few more things to consider when reading this example. See if you can find the answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why can’t the lawyer redeem the third execution path at any time by selecting it with FALSE on the unlocking script?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many execution paths can be used 5, 35, and 105 days, respectively, after the UTXO is mined?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are the funds lost if the lawyer loses his key? Does your answer change if 91 days have elapsed?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do the partners \"reset\" the clock every 29 or 89 days to prevent the lawyer from accessing the funds?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why do some CHECKSIG opcodes in this script have the VERIFY suffix while others don’t?\n",

    "## Segregated Witness\n",
    "Segregated Witness (segwit) is an upgrade to the bitcoin consensus rules and network protocol, proposed and implemented as a BIP-9 soft-fork that was activated on bitcoin’s mainnet on August 1st, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In cryptography, the term \"witness\" is used to describe a solution to a cryptographic puzzle.<br> In bitcoin terms, the witness satisfies a cryptographic condition placed on a unspent transaction output (UTXO).**\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the context of bitcoin, a digital signature is one type of witness, but **a witness is more broadly any solution that can satisfy the conditions imposed on an UTXO and unlock that UTXO for spending. The term “witness” is a more general term for an “unlocking script” or “scriptSig”.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before segwit’s introduction, every input in a transaction was followed by the witness data that unlocked it**. The witness data was embedded in the transaction as part of each input. **The term segregated witness, or segwit for short, simply means separating the signature or unlocking script of a specific output. Think \"separate scriptSig,\" or “separate signature” in the simplest form.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segregated Witness therefore is an architectural change to bitcoin that aims to move the witness data from the scriptSig (unlocking script) field of a transaction into a separate witness data structure that accompanies a transaction.** Clients may request transaction data with or without the accompanying witness data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will look at some of the benefits of Segregated Witness, describe the mechanism used to deploy and implement this architecture change, and demonstrate the use of Segregated Witness in transactions and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Segregated Witness is defined by the following BIPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BIP-141: The main definition of Segregated Witness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BIP-143: Transaction Signature Verification for Version 0 Witness Program\n",
    "\n",
    "- BIP-144: Peer Services—New network messages and serialization formats\n",
    "\n",
    "- BIP-145: getblocktemplate Updates for Segregated Witness (for mining)\n",
    "\n",
    "- BIP-173: Base32 address format for native v0-16 witness outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Segregated Witness (Segregated Unlocking Script)?\n",
    "Segregated Witness is an architectural change that has several effects on the scalability, security, economic incentives, and performance of bitcoin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transaction Malleability**:<br>\n",
    "By moving the witness outside the transaction, the transaction hash used as an identifier no longer includes the witness data. Since the witness data is the only part of the transaction that can be modified by a third party (see Transaction identifiers), removing it also removes the opportunity for transaction malleability attacks. With Segregated Witness, transaction hashes become immutable by anyone other than the creator of the transaction, which greatly improves the implementation of many other protocols that rely on advanced bitcoin transaction construction, such as payment channels, chained transactions, and lightning networks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Script Versioning**:<br>\n",
    "With the introduction of Segregated Witness scripts, every locking script is preceded by a script version number, similar to how transactions and blocks have version numbers. The addition of a script version number allows the scripting language to be upgraded in a backward-compatible way (i.e., using soft fork upgrades) to introduce new script operands, syntax, or semantics. The ability to upgrade the scripting language in a nondisruptive way will greatly accelerate the rate of innovation in bitcoin.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network and Storage Scaling**:<br>\n",
    "The witness data is often a big contributor to the total size of a transaction. More complex scripts such as those used for multisig or payment channels are very large. In some cases these scripts account for the majority (more than 75%) of the data in a transaction. By moving the witness data outside the transaction, Segregated Witness improves bitcoin’s scalability. Nodes can prune the witness data after validating the signatures, or ignore it altogether when doing simplified payment verification. The witness data doesn’t need to be transmitted to all nodes and does not need to be stored on disk by all nodes.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signature Verification Optimization**:<br>\n",
    "Segregated Witness upgrades the signature functions (CHECKSIG, CHECKMULTISIG, etc.) to reduce the algorithm’s computational complexity. Before segwit, the algorithm used to produce a signature required a number of hash operations that was proportional to the size of the transaction. Data-hashing computations increased in O($n^{2}$) with respect to the number of signature operations, introducing a substantial computational burden on all nodes verifying the signature. With segwit, the algorithm is changed to reduce the complexity to O(n).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Offline Signing Improvement**:<br>\n",
    "Segregated Witness signatures incorporate the value (amount) referenced by each input in the hash that is signed. Previously, an offline signing device, such as a hardware wallet, would have to verify the amount of each input before signing a transaction. This was usually accomplished by streaming a large amount of data about the previous transactions referenced as inputs. Since the amount is now part of the commitment hash that is signed, an offline device does not need the previous transactions. If the amounts do not match (are misrepresented by a compromised online system), the signature will be invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Segregated Witness Works\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, Segregated Witness appears to be a change to how transactions are constructed and therefore a transaction-level feature, but it is not. Rather, **Segregated Witness is a change to how individual UTXO are spent and therefore is a per-output feature**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A transaction can spend Segregated Witness outputs or traditional (inline-witness) outputs or both. Therefore, it does not make much sense to refer to a transaction as a “Segregated Witness transaction”. Rather **we should refer to specific transaction outputs as “Segregated Witness outputs\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a transaction spends an UTXO, it must provide a witness. In a traditional UTXO, the locking script requires that witness data be provided inline in the transaction input of the transaction that spends the UTXO. **A Segregated Witness UTXO, however, specifies a locking script that can be satisfied with witness data outside of the input (i.e. segregated).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soft Fork (Backward Compatibility)\n",
    "\n",
    "Segregated Witness is a significant change to the way outputs and transactions are architected. Such a change would normally require a simultaneous change in every bitcoin node and wallet to change the consensus rules—what is known as a **hard fork**. Instead, segregated witness is introduced with a much less disruptive change, which is backward compatible, known as a **soft fork**. This type of upgrade allows nonupgraded software to ignore the changes and continue to operate without any disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segregated Witness outputs are constructed so that older systems that are not segwit-aware can still validate them**. To an old wallet or node, a Segregated Witness output looks like an output that *anyone can spend*. Such outputs can be spent with an empty signature, therefore the fact that there is no signature inside the transaction (it is segregated) does not invalidate the transaction. Newer wallets and mining nodes, however, see the Segregated Witness output and expect to find a valid witness for it in the transaction’s witness data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segregated Witness Output and Transaction Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at some of our example transactions and see how they would change with Segregated Witness. \n",
    "- We’ll first look at how a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) payment is transformed with the Segregated Witness program, **P2WPKH**.\n",
    "- Then, we’ll look at the Segregated Witness equivalent for Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) scripts, **P2WSH**.\n",
    "- Finally, we’ll look at how both of the preceding Segregated Witness programs can be embedded inside a P2SH script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Buying a cup of coffee example, Alice created a transaction to pay Bob for a cup of coffee. That transaction created a P2PKH output with a value of 0.015 BTC that was spendable by Bob. The output’s script (locking script) looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example P2PKH output script<br>\n",
    "`DUP HASH160 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7 EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "With Segregated Witness, Alice wallet would create a Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) script, which looks like this:<br>\n",
    "Example P2WPKH output script<br>\n",
    "`0 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7`\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, a Segregated Witness output’s locking script is much simpler than a traditional output. **It consists of two values that are pushed on to the script evaluation stack**. \n",
    "- To an old (nonsegwit-aware) bitcoin client, the two pushes would look like an output that anyone can spend and does not require a signature (or rather, can be spent with an empty signature). \n",
    "- To a newer, segwit-aware client, **the first number (0) is interpreted as a version number (the witness version)** and the second part (20 bytes) is the equivalent of a locking script known as a witness program. **The 20-byte witness program is simply the hash of the public key, as in a P2PKH script.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s look at the corresponding transaction that Bob uses to spend this output. For the original script (nonsegwit), Bob’s transaction would have to include a signature within the transaction input:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/P2PKHwithSignature.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to spend the Segregated Witness output, the transaction has no signature on that input. Instead, Bob’s transaction has an empty scriptSig and includes a Segregated Witness, outside the transaction itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/P2WPKHwithWitnessData.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Wallet construction of P2WPKH\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is extremely important to note that P2WPKH should only be created by the payee (recipient) and not converted by the sender from a known public key, P2PKH script, or address**. The sender has no way of knowing if the recipient’s wallet has the ability to construct segwit transactions and spend P2WPKH outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, **P2WPKH outputs must be constructed from the hash of a compressed public key. Uncompressed public keys are nonstandard in segwit** and may be explicitly disabled by a future soft fork. If the hash used in the P2WPKH came from an uncompressed public key, it may be unspendable and you may lose funds. P2WPKH outputs should be created by the payee’s (recipients) wallet by deriving a compressed public key from their private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **P2WPKH should be constructed by the payee (recipient) by converting a compressed public key to a P2WPKH hash**. You should never transform a P2PKH script, bitcoin address, or uncompressed public key to a P2WPKH witness script.\n",

    "The second type of witness program corresponds to a Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) script. We saw this type of script in Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) section. In that example, P2SH was used by Mohammed’s company to express a multisignature script. Payments to Mohammed’s company were encoded with a locking script like this:\n",

    "This P2SH script references the hash of a redeem script that defines a 2-of-3 multisignature requirement to spend funds.

    "Now, let’s look at how this entire example would be upgraded to segwit. **If Mohammed’s customers were using a segwit-compatible wallet, they would make a payment, creating a Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH) output** that would look like this:\n",

    "Again, as with the example of P2WPKH, you can see that the Segregated Witness equivalent script is a lot simpler and omits the various script operands that you see in P2SH scripts.

    "**In the previous two sections, we demonstrated two types of witness programs: Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) and Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH). Both types of witness programs consist of a single byte version number followed by a longer hash**. They look very similar, but are interpreted very differently: one is interpreted as a public key hash, which is satisfied by a signature and the other as a script hash, which is satisfied by a redeem script. The critical difference between them is the length of the hash:\n",

    "### Upgrading to Segregated Witness\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the previous examples, upgrading to Segregated Witness is a two-step process. \n",
    "- First, wallets must create special segwit type outputs. Then, these outputs can be spent by wallets that know how to construct Segregated Witness transactions. In the examples, Alice’s wallet was **segwit-aware and able to create special outputs with Segregated Witness scripts.**\n",
    "- Secondly, **Bob’s wallet is also segwit-aware and able to spend those outputs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What may not be obvious from the example is that in practice, **Alice’s wallet needs to know that Bob uses a segwit-aware wallet and can spend these outputs**. Otherwise, if Bob’s wallet is not upgraded and Alice tries to make segwit payments to Bob, Bob’s wallet will not be able to detect these payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For P2WPKH and P2WSH payment types, both the sender and the recipient wallets need to be upgraded to be able to use segwit. Furthermore, the sender’s wallet needs to know that the recipient’s wallet is segwit-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segregated Witness will not be implemented simultaneously across the entire network. Rather, Segregated Witness is implemented as a backward-compatible upgrade, where old and new clients can coexist**. Wallet developers will independently upgrade wallet software to add segwit capabilities. The P2WPKH and P2WSH payment types are used when both sender and recipient are segwit-aware. The traditional P2PKH and P2SH will continue to work for nonupgraded wallets. \n",
    "\n",
    "That leaves two important scenarios, which are addressed in the next section:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s assume, for example, that Alice’s wallet is not upgraded to segwit, but Bob’s wallet is upgraded and can handle segwit transactions. Alice and Bob can use \"old\" non-segwit transactions. But **Bob would likely want to use segwit to reduce transaction fees, taking advantage of the discount that applies to witness data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case **Bob’s wallet can construct a P2SH address that contains a segwit script inside it**. Alice’s wallet sees this as a \"normal\" P2SH address and can make payments to it without any knowledge of segwit. Bob’s wallet can then spend this payment with a segwit transaction, taking full advantage of segwit and reducing transaction fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both forms of witness scripts, P2WPKH and P2WSH, can be embedded in a P2SH address**. The first is noted as P2SH(P2WPKH) and the second is noted as P2SH(P2WSH).\n",

    "\n",
    "Mohammed’s company can then construct segwit transactions to spend these payments, taking advantage of segwit features including lower transaction fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Segregated Witness addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after segwit activation, it will take some time until most wallets are upgraded. At first, segwit will be embedded in P2SH, as we saw in the previous section, to ease compatibility between segit-aware and unaware wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **once wallets are broadly supporting segwit, it makes sense to encode witness scripts directly in a native address format designed for segwit, rather than embed it in P2SH.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The native segwit address format is defined in BIP-173:<br>\n",
    "[BIP-173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki): Base32 address format for native v0-16 witness outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-173 only encodes witness (P2WPKH and P2WSH) scripts**. It is not compatible with non-segwit P2PKH or P2SH scripts. **BIP-173 is a checksummed Base32 encoding**, as compared to the Base58 encoding of a \"traditional\" bitcoin address. BIP-173 addesses are also called **bech32 addresses, pronounced \"beh-ch thirty two\", alluding to the use of a \"BCH\" error detection algorithm and 32-character encoding set.**\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-173 addresses use **32 lower-case-only alphanumeric character set, carefully selected to reduce errors from misreading or mistyping**. By choosing a lower-case-only character set, bech32 is easier to read, speak, and 45% more efficient to encode in QR codes.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**The BCH error detection algorithm is a vast improvement over the previous checksum algorithm (from Base58Check), allowing not only detection but also correction of errors.** Address-input interfaces (such as text-fields in forms) can detect and highlight which character was most likely mistyped when they detect an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the BIP-173 specification, here are some examples of bech32 addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mainnet P2WPKH<br>\n",
    "`bc1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4`\n",

    "This prefix \"bc\" or \"tb\" identifying mainnet or testnet.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The separator<br>\n",
    "The digit \"1\", which is not part of the 32-character encoding set and can only appear in this position as a separator.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data part <br>\n",
    "A minimum of 6 alphanumeric characters, the checksum encoded witness script\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, only a few wallets accept or produce native segwit bech32 addresses, but as segwit adoption increases, you will see these more and more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction identifiers\n",
    "One of the **greatest benefits of Segregated Witness is that it eliminates third-party transaction malleability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before segwit, transactions could have their signatures subtly modified by third parties, **changing their transaction ID (hash) without changing any fundamental properties (inputs, outputs, amounts). This created opportunities for denial-of-service attacks as well as attacks against poorly written wallet software that assumed unconfirmed transaction hashes were immutable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of Segregated Witness, transactions have two identifiers, **txid and wtxid**. The traditional transaction ID txid is the double-SHA256 hash of the serialized transaction, without the witness data. A transaction wtxid is the double-SHA256 hash of the new serialization format of the transaction with witness data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The traditional txid is calculated in exactly the same way as with a nonsegwit transaction. However, since the segwit transaction has empty scriptSigs in every input, there is no part of the transaction that can be modified by a third party.** Therefore, in a segwit transaction, the txid is immutable by a third party, even when the transaction is unconfirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wtxid is like an \"extended\" ID, in that the hash also incorporates the witness data. If a transaction is transmitted without witness data, then the wtxid and txid are identical. **Note than since the wtxid includes witness data (signatures) and since witness data may be malleable, the wtxid should be considered malleable until the transaction is confirmed. Only the txid of a segwit transaction can be considered immutable by third parties and only if all the inputs of the transaction are segwit inputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">Segregated Witness transactions have two IDs: txid and wtxid. The txid is the hash of the transaction without the witness data and the wtxid is the hash inclusive of witness data. The txid of a transaction where all inputs are segwit inputs is not susceptible to third-party transaction malleability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segregated Witness' New Signing Algorithm\n",
    "Segregated Witness modifies the semantics of the four signature verification functions (CHECKSIG, CHECKSIGVERIFY, CHECKMULTISIG, and CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY), changing the way a transaction commitment hash is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signatures in bitcoin transactions are applied on a commitment hash**, which is calculated from the transaction data, locking specific parts of the data indicating the signer’s commitment to those values. For example, in a simple `SIGHASH_ALL` type signature, the commitment hash includes all inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the way the commitment hash was calculated introduced the possibility that a node verifying the signature can be forced to perform a significant number of hash computations. Specifically, **the hash operations increase in O($n^2$) with respect to the number of signature operations in the transaction. An attacker could therefore create a transaction with a very large number of signature operations, causing the entire bitcoin network to have to perform hundreds or thousands of hash operations to verify the transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Segwit represented an opportunity to address this problem by changing the way the commitment hash is calculated. For segwit version 0 witness programs, signature verification occurs using an improved commitment hash algorithm as specified in BIP-143.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The new algorithm achieves two important goals**:\n",
    "- Firstly, **the number of hash operations increases by a much more gradual O(n) to the number of signature operations**, reducing the opportunity to create denial-of-service attacks with overly complex transactions. <br><br>\n",
    "- Secondly, **the commitment hash now also includes the value (amounts) of each input as part of the commitment. This means that a signer can commit to a specific input value without needing to \"fetch\" and check the previous transaction referenced by the input**. In the case of offline devices, such as hardware wallets, this greatly simplifies the communication between the host and the hardware wallet, removing the need to stream previous transactions for validation. A hardware wallet can accept the input value \"as stated\" by an untrusted host. Since the signature is invalid if that input value is not correct, the hardware wallet doesn’t need to validate the value before signing the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Incentives for Segregated Witness\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin mining nodes and full nodes incur costs for the resources used to support the bitcoin network and the blockchain. **As the volume of bitcoin transactions increases, so does the cost of resources (CPU, network bandwidth, disk space, memory). Miners are compensated for these costs through fees that are proportional to the size (in bytes) of each transaction**. Non-mining full nodes are not compensated, so they incur these costs because they have a need to run an authoritative fully validating full-index node, perhaps because they use the node to operate a bitcoin business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without transaction fees, the growth in bitcoin data would arguably increase dramatically. Fees are intended to align the needs of bitcoin users with the burden their transactions impose on the network, through a market-based price discovery mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of fees based on transaction size treats all the data in the transaction as equal in cost. But from the perspective of full nodes and miners, some parts of a transaction carry much higher costs. Every transaction added to the bitcoin network affects the consumption of four resources on nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disk Space**<br>\n",
    "Every transaction is stored in the blockchain, adding to the total size of the blockchain. The blockchain is stored on disk, but the storage can be optimized by “pruning” older transactions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPU**<br>\n",
    "Every transaction must be validated, which requires CPU time.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bandwidth**<br>\n",
    "Every transaction is transmitted (through flood propagation) across the network at least once. Without any optimization in the block propagation protocol, transactions are transmitted again as part of a block, doubling the impact on network capacity.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory**<br>\n",
    "Nodes that validate transactions keep the UTXO index or the entire UTXO set in memory to speed up validation. Because memory is at least one order of magnitude more expensive than disk, growth of the UTXO set contributes disproportionately to the cost of running a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the list, not every part of a transaction has an equal impact on the cost of running a node or on the ability of bitcoin to scale to support more transactions. **The most expensive part of a transaction are the newly created outputs, as they are added to the in-memory UTXO set. By comparison, signatures (aka witness data) add the least burden to the network and the cost of running a node, because witness data are only validated once and then never used again. Furthermore, immediately after receiving a new transaction and validating witness data, nodes can discard that witness data.** If fees are calculated on transaction size, without discriminating between these two types of data, then the market incentives of fees are not aligned with the actual costs imposed by a transaction. In fact, the current fee structure actually encourages the opposite behavior, because witness data is the largest part of a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incentives created by fees matter because they affect the behavior of wallets. All wallets must implement some strategy for assembling transactions that takes into consideration a number of factors, such as privacy (reducing address reuse), fragmentation (making lots of loose change), and fees. **If the fees are overwhelmingly motivating wallets to use as few inputs as possible in transactions, this can lead to UTXO picking and change address strategies that inadvertently bloat the UTXO set.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions consume UTXO in their inputs and create new UTXO with their outputs. A transaction, therefore, that has more inputs than outputs will result in a decrease in the UTXO set, whereas a transaction that has more outputs than inputs will result in an increase in the UTXO set. **Let’s consider the difference between inputs and outputs and call that the “Net-new-UTXO.” That’s an important metric, as it tells us what impact a transaction will have on the most expensive network-wide resource, the in-memory UTXO set. A transaction with positive Net-new-UTXO adds to that burden. A transaction with a negative Net-new-UTXO reduces the burden.** We would therefore want to encourage transactions that are either negative Net-new-UTXO or neutral with zero Net-new-UTXO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example of what incentives are created by the transaction fee calculation, with and without Segregated Witness. We will look at two different transactions. **Transaction A is a 3-input, 2-output transaction, which has a Net-new-UTXO metric of –1, meaning it consumes one more UTXO than it creates, reducing the UTXO set by one. Transaction B is a 2-input, 3-output transaction, which has a Net-new-UTXO metric of 1, meaning it adds one UTXO to the UTXO set, imposing additional cost on the entire bitcoin network.** Both transactions use multisignature (2-of-3) scripts to demonstrate how complex scripts increase the impact of segregated witness on fees. Let’s assume a **transaction fee of 30 satoshi per byte and a 75% fee discount on witness data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Without Segregated Witness:<br>\n",
    "Transaction A fee: 25,710 satoshi<br>\n",
    "Transaction B fee: 18,990 satoshi<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- With Segregated Witness:<br>\n",
    "Transaction A fee: 8,130 satoshi<br>\n",
    "Transaction B fee: 12,045 satoshi<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both transactions are less expensive when segregated witness is implemented. But **comparing the costs between the two transactions, we see that before Segregated Witness, the fee is higher for the transaction that has a negative Net-new-UTXO. After Segregated Witness, the transaction fees align with the incentive to minimize new UTXO creation by not inadvertently penalizing transactions with many inputs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Segregated Witness therefore has two main effects on the fees paid by bitcoin users. \n",
    "- Firstly, **segwit reduces the overall cost of transactions by discounting witness data** and increasing the capacity of the bitcoin blockchain.\n",
    "- Secondly, **segwit’s discount on witness data corrects a misalignment of incentives** that may have inadvertently created more bloat in the UTXO set.\n",

    "## Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin is structured as a peer-to-peer network architecture on top of the internet**. The term peer-to-peer, or P2P, means that the computers that participate in the network are peers to each other, that **they are all equal, that there are no \"special\" nodes, and that all nodes share the burden of providing network services**. The network nodes interconnect in a mesh network with a \"flat\" topology. **There is no server, no centralized service, and no hierarchy within the network. Nodes in a P2P network both provide and consume services at the same time with reciprocity (the practice of exchanging things with others for mutual benefit) acting as the incentive for participation**. P2P networks are inherently resilient, decentralized, and open. A preeminent example of a P2P network architecture was the early internet itself, where nodes on the IP network were equal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s internet architecture is more hierarchical, but the Internet Protocol still retains its flat-topology essence. Beyond bitcoin, the largest and most successful application of P2P technologies is file sharing, with Napster as the pioneer and BitTorrent as the most recent evolution of the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin’s P2P network architecture is much more than a topology choice. Bitcoin is a P2P digital cash system by design, and the network architecture is both a reflection and a foundation of that core characteristic. **Decentralization of control is a core design principle that can only be achieved and maintained by a flat, decentralized P2P consensus network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The term \"bitcoin network\" refers to the collection of nodes running the bitcoin P2P protocol.** In addition to the bitcoin P2P protocol, there are other protocols such as Stratum that are used for mining and lightweight or mobile wallets. **These additional protocols are provided by gateway routing servers that access the bitcoin network using the bitcoin P2P protocol and then extend that network to nodes running other protocols**. For example, Stratum servers connect Stratum mining nodes via the Stratum protocol to the main bitcoin network and bridge the Stratum protocol to the bitcoin P2P protocol. **We use the term \"extended bitcoin network\" to refer to the overall network that includes the bitcoin P2P protocol, pool-mining protocols, the Stratum protocol, and any other related protocols connecting the components of the bitcoin system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node Types and Roles\n",

    "\n",
    "**The main bitcoin network, running the bitcoin P2P protocol, consists of between 5,000 and 8,000 listening nodes running various versions of the bitcoin reference client (Bitcoin Core) and a few hundred nodes running various other implementations of the bitcoin P2P protocol, such as Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, BitcoinJ, Libbitcoin, btcd, and bcoin**. A small percentage of the nodes on the bitcoin P2P network are also mining nodes, competing in the mining process, validating transactions, and creating new blocks. **Various large companies interface with the bitcoin network by running full-node clients based on the Bitcoin Core client, with full copies of the blockchain and a network node, but without mining or wallet functions. These nodes act as network edge routers**, allowing various other services (exchanges, wallets, block explorers, merchant payment processing) to be built on top.\n",

    "## Bitcoin Relay Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "While the bitcoin P2P network serves the general needs of a broad variety of node types, it exhibits too high network latency for the specialized needs of bitcoin mining nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin miners are engaged in a time-sensitive competition to solve the Proof-of-Work problem and extend the blockchain. While participating in this competition, bitcoin miners must minimize the time between the propagation of a winning block and the beginning of the next round of competition. In mining, network latency is directly related to profit margins.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Bitcoin Relay Network is a network that attempts to minimize the latency in the transmission of blocks between miners**. The original Bitcoin Relay Network was created by core developer Matt Corallo in 2015 to enable fast synchronization of blocks between miners with very low latency. **The original Relay Network consisted of several specialized nodes hosted on the Amazon Web Services infrastructure around the world and served to connect the majority of miners and mining pools.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Bitcoin Relay Network was replaced in 2016 with the introduction of the **Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine or FIBRE**, also created by core developer Matt Corallo. FIBRE is a UDP-based relay network that relays blocks within a network of nodes. **FIBRE implements compact block optimization to further reduce the amount of data transmitted and the network latency.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another relay network (still in the proposal phase) is Falcon, based on research at Cornell University. **Falcon uses \"cut-through-routing\" instead of \"store-and-forward\" to reduce latency by propagating parts of blocks as they are received rather than waiting until a complete block is received.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relay networks are not replacements for bitcoin’s P2P network. **Instead they are overlay networks that provide additional connectivity between nodes with specialized needs**. Like freeways are not replacements for rural roads, but rather shortcuts between two points with heavy traffic, you still need small roads to connect to the freeways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new node boots up, it must discover other bitcoin nodes on the network in order to participate. To start this process, a **new node must discover at least one existing node on the network and connect to it. The geographic location of other nodes is irrelevant; the bitcoin network topology is not geographically defined.** Therefore, any existing bitcoin nodes can be selected at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To connect to a known peer, nodes establish a TCP connection, usually to port 8333** (the port generally known as the one used by bitcoin), or an alternative port if one is provided. **Upon establishing a connection, the node will start a \"handshake\" by transmitting a version message, which contains basic identifying information, including**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- nVersion: The bitcoin P2P protocol version the client \"speaks\" (e.g., 70002)<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- nLocalServices: A list of local services supported by the node, currently just NODE_NETWORK<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- nTime: The current time<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- addrYou: The IP address of the remote node as seen from this node<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- addrMe: The IP address of the local node, as discovered by the local node<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- subver: sub-version showing the type of software running on this node (e.g., /Satoshi:0.9.2.1/)<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- BestHeight: The block height of this node’s blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"version message\"** is always the first message sent by any peer to another peer. **The local peer receiving a version message will examine the remote peer’s reported nVersion and decide if the remote peer is compatible. If the remote peer is compatible, the local peer will acknowledge the version message and establish a connection by sending a \"verack\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does a new node find peers?**<br>\n",
    "It could be done in following two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first method is to query DNS using a number of \"DNS seeds,\" which are DNS servers that provide a list of IP addresses of bitcoin nodes**. Some of those DNS seeds provide a static list of IP addresses of stable bitcoin listening nodes. Some of the DNS seeds are custom implementations of BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon) that return a random subset from a list of bitcoin node addresses collected by a crawler or a long-running bitcoin node. **The Bitcoin Core client contains the names of five different DNS seeds**. The diversity of ownership and diversity of implementation of the different DNS seeds offers a high level of reliability for the initial bootstrapping process. **In the Bitcoin Core client, the option to use the DNS seeds is controlled by the option switch -dnsseed** (set to 1 by default, to use the DNS seed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, a bootstrapping node that knows nothing of the network must be given the IP address of at least one bitcoin node, after which it can establish connections through further introductions. **The command-line argument -seednode can be used to connect to one node just for introductions using it as a seed. After the initial seed node is used to form introductions, the client will disconnect from it and use the newly discovered peers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/InitialHandshakesBtwPeers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once one or more connections are established:\n",
    "- **the new node will send an addr message containing its own IP address to its neighbors. The neighbors will, in turn, forward the addr message to their neighbors**, ensuring that the newly connected node becomes well known and better connected.\n",
    "- Additionally, **the newly connected node can send getaddr to the neighbors, asking them to return a list of IP addresses of other peers. That way, a node can find peers to connect to and advertise its existence on the network** for other nodes to find it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following shows the address discovery protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AddrPropagationAnddiscovery.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A node must connect to a few different peers in order to establish diverse paths into the bitcoin network. **Paths are not reliable—nodes come and go—and so the node must continue to discover new nodes as it loses old connections as well as assist other nodes when they bootstrap**. Only one connection is needed to bootstrap, because the first node can offer introductions to its peer nodes and those peers can offer further introductions. **It’s also unnecessary and wasteful of network resources to connect to more than a handful of nodes. After bootstrapping, a node will remember its most recent successful peer connections, so that if it is rebooted it can quickly reestablish connections with its former peer network. If none of the former peers respond to its connection request, the node can use the seed nodes to bootstrap again.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If there is no traffic on a connection, nodes will periodically send a message to maintain the connection. If a node has not communicated on a connection for more than 90 minutes, it is assumed to be disconnected and a new peer will be sought**. Thus, the network dynamically adjusts to transient nodes and network problems, and can organically grow and shrink as needed without any central control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full nodes are nodes that maintain a full blockchain with all transactions. More accurately, they probably should be called \"full blockchain nodes\".** In the early years of bitcoin, all nodes were full nodes and currently the Bitcoin Core client is a full blockchain node. In the past two years, however, new forms of bitcoin clients have been introduced that do not maintain a full blockchain but run as lightweight clients. We’ll examine these in more detail in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full blockchain nodes maintain a complete and up-to-date copy of the bitcoin blockchain with all the transactions, which they independently build and verify, starting with the very first block (genesis block) and building up to the latest known block in the network**. A full blockchain node can independently and authoritatively verify any transaction without recourse or reliance on any other node or source of information. The full blockchain node relies on the network to receive updates about new blocks of transactions, which it then verifies and incorporates into its local copy of the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running a full blockchain node gives you the pure bitcoin experience: independent verification of all transactions without the need to rely on, or trust, any other systems. It’s easy to tell if you’re running a full node because it requires more than one hundred gigabytes of persistent storage (disk space) to store the full blockchain**. If you need a lot of disk and it takes two to three days to sync to the network, you are running a full node. That is the price of complete independence and freedom from central authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few alternative implementations of full blockchain bitcoin clients, built using different programming languages and software architectures. However, **the most common implementation is the reference client Bitcoin Core, also known as the Satoshi client. More than 75% of the nodes on the bitcoin network run various versions of Bitcoin Core. It is identified as \"Satoshi\" in the sub-version string sent in the version message** for example: /Satoshi:0.8.6/.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exchanging \"Inventory\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing a full node will do once it connects to peers is try to construct a complete blockchain. **If it is a brand-new node and has no blockchain at all, it only knows one block, the genesis block, which is statically embedded in the client software.** Starting with block #0 (the genesis block), the new node will have to download hundreds of thousands of blocks to synchronize with the network and reestablish the full blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of syncing the blockchain starts with the version message, because that contains BestHeight, a node’s current blockchain height (number of blocks). A node will see the version messages from its peers, know how many blocks they each have, and be able to compare to how many blocks it has in its own blockchain. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Peered nodes will exchange a getblocks message that contains the hash (fingerprint) of the top block on their local blockchain. One of the peers will be able to identify the received hash as belonging to a block that is not at the top, but rather belongs to an older block, thus deducing that its own local blockchain is longer than its peer’s.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The peer that has the longer blockchain has more blocks than the other node and can identify which blocks the other node needs in order to \"catch up.\" It will identify the first 500 blocks to share and transmit their hashes using an inv (inventory) message. The node missing these blocks will then retrieve them, by issuing a series of getdata messages requesting the full block data and identifying the requested blocks using the hashes from the inv message.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume, for example, that a node only has the genesis block:\n",
    "- It will then receive an inv message from its peers containing the hashes of the next 500 blocks in the chain.\n",
    "- It will start requesting blocks from all of its connected peers, spreading the load and ensuring that it doesn’t overwhelm any peer with requests. The node keeps track of how many blocks are \"in transit\" per peer connection, meaning blocks that it has requested but not received, checking that it does not exceed a limit (MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER).\n",
    "- This way, if it needs a lot of blocks, it will only request new ones as previous requests are fulfilled, allowing the peers to control the pace of updates and not overwhelm the network. As each block is received, it is added to the blockchain. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the local blockchain is gradually built up, more blocks are requested and received, and the process continues until the node catches up to the rest of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This process of comparing the local blockchain with the peers and retrieving any missing blocks happens any time a node goes offline for any period of time**. Whether a node has been offline for a few minutes and is missing a few blocks, or a month and is missing a few thousand blocks, it starts by sending getblocks, gets an inv response, and starts downloading the missing blocks. Following shows **the inventory and block propagation protocol**:\n",

    "## Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all nodes have the ability to store the full blockchain. Many bitcoin clients are designed to run on space- and power-constrained devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or embedded systems. **For such devices, a simplified payment verification (SPV) method is used to allow them to operate without storing the full blockchain. These types of clients are called SPV clients or lightweight clients**. As bitcoin adoption surges, the SPV node is becoming the most common form of bitcoin node, especially for bitcoin wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SPV nodes download only the block headers and do not download the transactions included in each block**. The resulting chain of blocks, without transactions, is 1,000 times smaller than the full blockchain. SPV nodes cannot construct a full picture of all the UTXOs that are available for spending because they do not know about all the transactions on the network. **SPV nodes verify transactions using a slightly different method that relies on peers to provide partial views of relevant parts of the blockchain on demand.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy [Full Node vs SPV]:<br>\n",
    "A full node is like a tourist in a strange city, equipped with a detailed map of every street and every address. By comparison, an SPV node is like a tourist in a strange city asking random strangers for turn-by-turn directions while knowing only one main avenue. Although both tourists can verify the existence of a street by visiting it, the tourist without a map doesn’t know what lies down any of the side streets and doesn’t know what other streets exist. Positioned in front of 23 Church Street, the tourist without a map cannot know if there are a dozen other \"23 Church Street\" addresses in the city and whether this is the right one. The mapless tourist’s best chance is to ask enough people and hope some of them are not trying to mug him.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SPV verifies transactions by reference to their depth in the blockchain instead of their height**. Whereas a full blockchain node will construct a fully verified chain of thousands of blocks and transactions reaching down the blockchain (back in time) all the way to the genesis block, an **SPV node will verify the chain of all blocks (but not all transactions) and link that chain to the transaction of interest.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when examining a transaction in block 300,000, a full node links all 300,000 blocks down to the genesis block and builds a full database of UTXO, establishing the validity of the transaction by confirming that the UTXO remains unspent. An SPV node cannot validate whether the UTXO is unspent. **Instead, the SPV node will establish a link between the transaction and the block that contains it, using a merkle path. Then, the SPV node waits until it sees the six blocks 300,001 through 300,006 piled on top of the block containing the transaction and verifies it by establishing its depth under blocks 300,006 to 300,001. The fact that other nodes on the network accepted block 300,000 and then did the necessary work to produce six more blocks on top of it is proof, by proxy, that the transaction was not a double-spend.**\n",
    "\n",
    "An SPV node cannot be persuaded that a transaction exists in a block when the transaction does not in fact exist. **The SPV node establishes the existence of a transaction in a block by requesting a merkle path proof and by validating the Proof-of-Work in the chain of blocks. However, a transaction’s existence can be \"hidden\" from an SPV node. An SPV node can definitely prove that a transaction exists but cannot verify that a transaction, such as a double-spend of the same UTXO, doesn’t exist because it doesn’t have a record of all transactions**. This vulnerability can be used in a denial-of-service attack or for a double-spending attack against SPV nodes. **To defend against this, an SPV node needs to connect randomly to several nodes, to increase the probability that it is in contact with at least one honest node**. This need to randomly connect means that SPV nodes also are vulnerable to network partitioning attacks or Sybil attacks, where they are connected to fake nodes or fake networks and do not have access to honest nodes or the real bitcoin network.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most practical purposes, well-connected SPV nodes are secure enough, striking a balance between resource needs, practicality, and security. For infallible security, however, nothing beats running a full blockchain node.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A full blockchain node verifies a transaction by checking the entire chain of thousands of blocks below it in order to guarantee that the UTXO is not spent, whereas **an SPV node checks how deep the block is buried by a handful of blocks above it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get the block headers, SPV nodes use a getheaders message instead of getblocks. The responding peer will send up to 2,000 block headers using a single headers message.** The process is otherwise the same as that used by a full node to retrieve full blocks. SPV nodes also set a filter on the connection to peers, to filter the stream of future blocks and transactions sent by the peers. **Any transactions of interest are retrieved using a getdata request. The peer generates a tx message containing the transactions, in response**. Following shows the synchronization of block headers:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/SPVSyncronizingBlockHeaders.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risking the privacy:**<br>\n",
    "Because SPV nodes need to retrieve specific transactions in order to selectively verify them, they also create a privacy risk. Unlike full blockchain nodes, which collect all transactions within each block, the SPV node’s requests for specific data can inadvertently reveal the addresses in their wallet. For example, a third party monitoring a network could keep track of all the transactions requested by a wallet on an SPV node and use those to associate bitcoin addresses with the user of that wallet, destroying the user’s privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution: Bloom Filters**<br>\n",
    "Shortly after the introduction of SPV/lightweight nodes, bitcoin developers added a feature called bloom filters to address the privacy risks of SPV nodes. **Bloom filters allow SPV nodes to receive a subset of the transactions without revealing precisely which addresses they are interested in, through a filtering mechanism that uses probabilities rather than fixed patterns.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bloom Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "**A bloom filter is a probabilistic search filter, a way to describe a desired pattern without specifying it exactly**. Bloom filters offer an efficient way to express a search pattern while protecting privacy. **They are used by SPV nodes to ask their peers for transactions matching a specific pattern, without revealing exactly which addresses, keys, or transactions they are searching for.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous analogy, a tourist without a map is asking for directions to a specific address, \"23 Church St.\" If she asks strangers for directions to this street, she inadvertently reveals her destination. A bloom filter is like asking, \"Are there any streets in this neighborhood whose name ends in R-C-H?\" A question like that reveals slightly less about the desired destination than asking for \"23 Church St.\" Using this technique, a tourist could specify the desired address in more detail such as \"ending in U-R-C-H\" or less detail as \"ending in H.\" **By varying the precision of the search, the tourist reveals more or less information, at the expense of getting more or less specific results. If she asks a less specific pattern, she gets a lot more possible addresses and better privacy, but many of the results are irrelevant**. If she asks for a very specific pattern, she gets fewer results but loses privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bloom filters serve this function by allowing an SPV node to specify a search pattern for transactions that can be tuned toward precision or privacy.**\n",
    "- A **more specific bloom filter** will produce accurate results, but at the expense of revealing what patterns the SPV node is interested in, thus revealing the addresses owned by the user’s wallet. \n",
    "- A **less specific bloom filter** will produce more data about more transactions, many irrelevant to the node, but will allow the node to maintain better privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Bloom Filters Work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bloom filters are implemented as a variable-size array of N binary digits (a bit field) and a variable number of M hash functions. The hash functions are designed to always produce an output that is between 1 and N, corresponding to the array of binary digits**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**The hash functions are generated deterministically**, so that any node implementing a bloom filter will always use the same hash functions and get the same results for a specific input. **By choosing different length (N) bloom filters and a different number (M) of hash functions, the bloom filter can be tuned, varying the level of accuracy and therefore privacy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we use a very small array of 16 bits and a set of three hash functions to demonstrate how bloom filters work.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/SimpleBloomFilter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The bloom filter is initialized so that the array of bits is all zeros**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a pattern to the bloom filter:\n",
    "- the pattern is hashed by each hash function in turn. \n",
    "- Applying the first hash function to the input results in a number between 1 and N. The corresponding bit in the array (indexed from 1 to N) is found and set to 1, thereby recording the output of the hash function.\n",
    "- Then, the next hash function is used to set another bit and so on. Once all M hash functions have been applied, the search pattern will be \"recorded\" in the bloom filter as M bits that have been changed from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is an example of adding a pattern \"A\" to the above simple bloom filter:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AddingPatterA2BloomFilter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a second pattern is as simple as repeating this process. The pattern is hashed by each hash function in turn and the result is recorded by setting the bits to 1. **Note that as a bloom filter is filled with more patterns, a hash function result might coincide with a bit that is already set to 1, in which case the bit is not changed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, as more patterns record on overlapping bits, the bloom filter starts to become saturated with more bits set to 1 and the accuracy of the filter decreases. **This is why the filter is a probabilistic data structure—it gets less accurate as more patterns are added. The accuracy depends on the number of patterns added versus the size of the bit array (N) and number of hash functions (M). A larger bit array and more hash functions can record more patterns with higher accuracy. A smaller bit array or fewer hash functions will record fewer patterns and produce less accuracy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is an example of adding a second pattern \"B\" to the simple bloom filter:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AddingPatterB2BloomFilter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To test if a pattern is part of a bloom filter, the pattern is hashed by each hash function and the resulting bit pattern is tested against the bit array. **If all the bits indexed by the hash functions are set to 1, then the pattern is probably recorded in the bloom filter. Because the bits may be set because of overlap from multiple patterns, the answer is not certain, but is rather probabilistic.** In simple terms, a bloom filter positive match is a \"**Maybe, Yes**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Following  is an example of testing the existence of pattern \"X\" in the simple bloom filter. The corresponding bits are set to 1, so the pattern is probably a match.\n",

    "![](./Images/IsPatternXIncluded.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, **if a pattern is tested against the bloom filter and any one of the bits is set to 0**, this proves that the pattern was not recorded in the bloom filter. **A negative result is not a probability, it is a certainty**. In simple terms, a negative match on a bloom filter is a \"**Definitely Not!**\"\n",
    "\n",

    "### How SPV Nodes Use Bloom Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom filters are used to filter the transactions (and blocks containing them) that an SPV node receives from its peers, selecting only transactions of interest to the SPV node without revealing which addresses or keys it is interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An SPV node will initialize a bloom filter as \"empty\"; in that state the bloom filter will not match any patterns. The SPV node will then make a list of all the addresses, keys, and hashes that it is interested in. It will do this by extracting the public key hash and script hash and transaction IDs from any UTXO controlled by its wallet. The SPV node then adds each of these to the bloom filter, so that the bloom filter will \"match\" if these patterns are present in a transaction, without revealing the patterns themselves.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The SPV node will then send a **filterload message*** to the peer, containing the bloom filter to use on the connection. Hence, **the peer loads up the bloom filter at his end and then the bloom filters are checked against each transaction**. The full node checks several parts of the transaction against the bloom filter, looking for a match including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The transaction ID\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data components from the locking scripts of each of the transaction outputs (every key and hash in the script)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each of the transaction inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each of the input signature data components (or witness scripts)\n",
    "\n",
    "By checking against all these components, bloom filters can be used to match public key hashes, scripts, OP_RETURN values, public keys in signatures, or any future component of a smart contract or complex script. **After a filter is established, the peer will then test each transaction’s outputs against the bloom filter. Only transactions that match the filter are sent to the node.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In response to a getdata message from the node, peers will send a merkleblock message that contains only block headers for blocks matching the filter and a merkle path for each matching transaction**. The peer will then also send tx messages containing the transactions matched by the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As the full node sends transactions to the SPV node, the SPV node discards any false positives and uses the correctly matched transactions to update its UTXO set and wallet balance. As it updates its own view of the UTXO set, it also modifies the bloom filter to match any future transactions referencing the UTXO it just found**. The full node then uses the new bloom filter to match new transactions and the whole process repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The node setting the bloom filter can interactively add patterns to the filter by sending a filteradd message. To clear the bloom filter, the node can send a filterclear message. Because it is not possible to remove a pattern from a bloom filter, a node has to clear and resend a new bloom filter if a pattern is no longer desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network protocol and bloom filter mechanism for SPV nodes is defined in [BIP-37 (Peer Services)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "### SPV Nodes and Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes that implement SPV have weaker privacy than a full node**. \n",
    "- A full node receives all transactions and therefore reveals no information about whether it is using some address in its wallet. \n",
    "- An SPV node receives a filtered list of transactions related to the addresses that are in its wallet. As a result, it reduces the privacy of the owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom filters are a way to reduce the loss of privacy. Without them, an SPV node would have to explicitly list the addresses it was interested in, creating a serious breach of privacy. However, **even with bloom filters, an adversary monitoring the traffic of an SPV client or connected to it directly as a node in the P2P network can collect enough information over time to learn the addresses in the wallet of the SPV client.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encrypted and Authenticated Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most new users of bitcoin assume that the network communications of a bitcoin node are encrypted. In fact, the original implementation of bitcoin communicates entirely in the clear**. While this is not a major privacy concern for full nodes, it is a **big problem for SPV nodes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a **way to increase the privacy and security of the bitcoin P2P network**, there are two solutions that provide encryption of the communications: \n",
    "- Tor Transport\n",
    "- P2P Authentication and Encryption with BIP-150/151.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tor Transport\n",
    "Tor, which stands for **The Onion Routing network, is a software project and network that offers encryption and encapsulation of data through randomized network paths that offer anonymity, untraceability and privacy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin Core offers several configuration options that allow you to run a bitcoin node with its traffic transported over the Tor network.** In addition, Bitcoin Core can also offer a Tor hidden service allowing other Tor nodes to connect to your node directly over Tor.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Bitcoin Core version 0.12, a node will offer a hidden Tor service automatically if it is able to connect to a local Tor service. If you have Tor installed and the Bitcoin Core process runs as a user with adequate permissions to access the Tor authentication cookie, it should work automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Peer-to-Peer Authentication and Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, BIP-150 and BIP-151, add support for P2P authentication and encryption in the bitcoin P2P network. These two BIPs define optional services that may be offered by compatible bitcoin nodes. BIP-151 enables negotiated encryption for all communications between two nodes that support BIP-151. **BIP-150 offers optional peer authentication that allows nodes to authenticate each other’s identity using ECDSA and private keys. BIP-150 requires that prior to authentication the two nodes have established encrypted communications as per BIP-151.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As of January 2017, BIP-150 and BIP-151 are not implemented in Bitcoin Core. However, the two proposals have been implemented by at least one alternative bitcoin client named bcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-150 and BIP-151 allow users to run SPV clients that connect to a trusted full node, using encryption and authentication to protect the privacy of the SPV client.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, authentication can be used to create networks of trusted bitcoin nodes and **prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks**. Finally, **P2P encryption, if deployed broadly, would strengthen the resistance of bitcoin to traffic analysis and privacy-eroding surveillance**, especially in totalitarian countries where internet use is heavily controlled and monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction Pools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Almost every node on the bitcoin network maintains a temporary list of unconfirmed transactions called the memory pool, mempool, or transaction pool**. Nodes use this pool to keep track of transactions that are known to the network but are not yet included in the blockchain. For example, **a wallet node will use the transaction pool to track incoming payments to the user’s wallet that have been received on the network but are not yet confirmed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As transactions are received and verified, they are added to the transaction pool and relayed to the neighboring nodes to propagate on the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some node implementations also maintain a separate pool of **orphaned transactions**. If a transaction’s inputs refer to a transaction that is not yet known, such as a missing parent, the orphan transaction will be stored temporarily in the **orphan pool** until the parent transaction arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When a transaction is added to the transaction pool, the orphan pool is checked for any orphans that reference this transaction’s outputs (its children). Any matching orphans are then validated. If valid, they are removed from the orphan pool and added to the transaction pool, completing the chain that started with the parent transaction.** In light of the newly added transaction, which is no longer an orphan, the process is repeated recursively looking for any further descendants, until no more descendants are found. Through this process, the arrival of a parent transaction triggers a cascade reconstruction of an entire chain of interdependent transactions by re-uniting the orphans with their parents all the way down the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both the transaction pool and orphan pool (where implemented) are stored in local memory and are not saved on persistent storage; rather, they are dynamically populated from incoming network messages**. When a node starts, both pools are empty and are gradually populated with new transactions received on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some implementations of the bitcoin client also maintain an UTXO database or pool, which is the set of all unspent outputs on the blockchain**. Although the name \"UTXO pool\" sounds similar to the transaction pool, it represents a different set of data. **Unlike the transaction and orphan pools, the UTXO pool is not initialized empty but instead contains millions of entries of unspent transaction outputs, everything that is unspent from all the way back to the genesis block**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction and Orphan Pool vs UTXO Pool**:\n",
    "- The transaction and orphan pools represent a **single node’s local perspective and might vary significantly from node to node** depending upon when the node was started or restarted, the **UTXO pool represents the emergent consensus of the network and therefore will vary little between nodes**.<br><br>\n",
    "- The transaction and orphan pools only contain **unconfirmed transactions**, while the UTXO pool only contains **confirmed outputs**.<br><br>\n",
    "- Whereas the transaction pool and orphan pool are stored in local memory and not on persistance storage, the UTXO pool may be housed in **local memory or as an indexed database table on persistent storage**.\n",

    "# The Blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**The blockchain data structure is an ordered, back-linked list of blocks of transactions**. The blockchain can be stored as a flat file, or in a simple database. **The Bitcoin Core client stores the blockchain metadata using Google’s LevelDB database. Blocks are linked \"back,\" each referring to the previous block in the chain. The blockchain is often visualized as a vertical stack, with blocks layered on top of each other and the first block serving as the foundation of the stack**. The visualization of blocks stacked on top of each other results in the use of terms such as **\"height\"** to refer to the distance from the first block, and \"top\" or \"tip\" to refer to the most recently added block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each block within the blockchain is identified by a hash, generated using the SHA256 cryptographic hash algorithm on the header of the block. Each block also references a previous block, known as the parent block, through the \"previous block hash\" field in the block header**. In other words, **each block contains the hash of its parent inside its own header**. The sequence of hashes linking each block to its parent creates a chain going back all the way to the first block ever created, known as the genesis block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a block has just one parent, it can temporarily have multiple children. **Each of the children refers to the same block as its parent and contains the same (parent) hash in the \"previous block hash\" field. Multiple children arise during a blockchain \"fork,\" a temporary situation that occurs when different blocks are discovered almost simultaneously by different miners. Eventually, only one child block becomes part of the blockchain and the \"fork\" is resolved**. Even though a block may have more than one child, **each block can have only one parent**. This is because a block has one single \"previous block hash\" field referencing its single parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"previous block hash\" field is inside the block header and thereby affects the current block’s hash. The child’s own identity changes if the parent’s identity changes. When the parent is modified in any way, the parent’s hash changes. The parent’s changed hash necessitates a change in the \"previous block hash\" pointer of the child. This in turn causes the child’s hash to change, which requires a change in the pointer of the grandchild, which in turn changes the grandchild, and so on. This cascade effect ensures that once a block has many generations following it, it cannot be changed without forcing a recalculation of all subsequent blocks**. \n",
    ">Because such a **recalculation would require enormous computation (and therefore energy consumption), the existence of a long chain of blocks makes the blockchain’s deep history immutable**, which is a **key feature of bitcoin’s security**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogical Explanation:**<br>\n",
    "One way to think about the blockchain is like layers in a geological formation, or glacier core sample. The surface layers might change with the seasons, or even be blown away before they have time to settle. But once you go a few inches deep, geological layers become more and more stable. By the time you look a few hundred feet down, you are looking at a snapshot of the past that has remained undisturbed for millions of years. **In the blockchain, the most recent few blocks might be revised if there is a chain recalculation due to a fork. The top six blocks are like a few inches of topsoil. But once you go more deeply into the blockchain, beyond six blocks, blocks are less and less likely to change. After 100 blocks back there is so much stability that the coinbase transaction—the transaction containing newly mined bitcoin—can be spent. A few thousand blocks back (a month) and the blockchain is settled history, for all practical purposes**. While the protocol always allows a chain to be undone by a longer chain and while the possibility of any block being reversed always exists, the probability of such an event decreases as time passes until it becomes infinitesimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of a Block\n",
    "\n",
    "A **block is a container data structure that aggregates transactions for inclusion in the public ledger, the blockchain. The block is made of a header, containing metadata, followed by a long list of transactions that make up the bulk of its size. The block header is 80 bytes, whereas the average transaction is at least 400 bytes and the average block contains more than 1900 transactions**. A complete block, with all transactions, is therefore 10,000 times larger than the block header. Following describes the structure of a block:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/StructureOfBlock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Header\n",
    "\n",
    "**The block header consists of three sets of block metadata**.\n",
    "- First, there is a **reference to a previous block hash**, which connects this block to the previous block in the blockchain.\n",
    "- The second set of metadata, namely the **difficulty, timestamp, and nonce**, relate to the mining competition.\n",
    "- The third piece of metadata is **the merkle tree root, a data structure used to efficiently summarize all the transactions in the block**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following describes the structure of a block header:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Struc-BlockHeader.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonce, difficulty target, and timestamp are used in the mining process and will be discussed in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Identifiers: Block Header Hash and Block Height\n",
    "\n",
    "**The primary identifier of a block is its cryptographic hash, a digital fingerprint, made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm. The resulting 32-byte hash is called the block hash but is more accurately the block header hash, because only the block header is used to compute it.** <br>\n",
    "For example, `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f` is the block hash of the first bitcoin block ever created. The block hash identifies a block uniquely and unambiguously and can be independently derived by any node by simply hashing the block header.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **the block hash is not actually included inside the block’s data structure, neither when the block is transmitted on the network, nor when it is stored on a node’s persistence storage as part of the blockchain. Instead, the block’s hash is computed by each node as the block is received from the network**. The block hash might be stored in a separate database table as part of the block’s metadata, to facilitate indexing and faster retrieval of blocks from disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A second way to identify a block is by its position in the blockchain, called the block height**. The first block ever created is at block height 0 (zero) and is the same block that was previously referenced by the following block hash `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f`. **A block can thus be identified in two ways: by referencing the block hash or by referencing the block height. Each subsequent block added \"on top\" of that first block is one position \"higher\" in the blockchain, like boxes stacked one on top of the other**. The block height on January 1, 2017 was approximately 446,000, meaning there were 446,000 blocks stacked on top of the first block created in January 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unlike the block hash, the block height is not a unique identifier. Although a single block will always have a specific and invariant block height, the reverse is not true—the block height does not always identify a single block. Two or more blocks might have the same block height, competing for the same position in the blockchain**. This scenario is discussed in detail in the Forks section. The block height is also not a part of the block’s data structure; it is not stored within the block. Each node dynamically identifies a block’s position (height) in the blockchain when it is received from the bitcoin network. The block height might also be stored as metadata in an indexed database table for faster retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A block’s block hash always identifies a single block uniquely. A block also always has a specific block height. However, it is not always the case that a specific block height can identify a single block. Rather, two or more blocks might compete for a single position in the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Genesis Block\n",
    "The first block in the blockchain is called the genesis block and was created in 2009. **It is the common ancestor of all the blocks in the blockchain, meaning that if you start at any block and follow the chain backward in time, you will eventually arrive at the genesis block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every node always starts with a blockchain of at least one block because the genesis block is statically encoded within the bitcoin client software, such that it cannot be altered**. Every node always \"knows\" the genesis block’s hash and structure, the fixed time it was created, and even the single transaction within. **Thus, every node has the starting point for the blockchain, a secure \"root\" from which to build a trusted blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following identifier hash belongs to the genesis block:<br>\n",
    "`000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can search for that block hash in any block explorer website, such as blockchain.info, and you will find a page describing the contents of this block, with a URL containing that hash: https://blockchain.info/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Bitcoin Core reference client on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/GenesisBlock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The genesis block contains a hidden message within it. The coinbase transaction input contains the text **\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\" This message was intended to offer proof of the earliest date this block was created, by referencing the headline of the British newspaper The Times**. It also serves as a tongue-in-cheek reminder of the importance of an independent monetary system, with bitcoin’s launch occurring at the same time as an unprecedented worldwide monetary crisis. **The message was embedded in the first block by Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s creator.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linking Blocks in the Blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin full nodes maintain a local copy of the blockchain, starting at the genesis block. The local copy of the blockchain is constantly updated as new blocks are found and used to extend the chain. **As a node receives incoming blocks from the network, it will validate these blocks and then link them to the existing blockchain. To establish a link, a node will examine the incoming block header and look for the \"previous block hash.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume, for example, that a node has 277,314 blocks in the local copy of the blockchain. The last block the node knows about is block 277,314, with a block header hash of:<br>\n",
    "`00000000000000027e7ba6fe7bad39faf3b5a83daed765f05f7d1b71a1632249`\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin node then receives a new block from the network, which it parses as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/NewBlockFromNet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Looking at this new block, the node finds the previousblockhash field, which contains the hash of its parent block. It is a hash known to the node, that's of the last block on the chain at height 277,314. Therefore, this new block is a child of the last block on the chain and extends the existing blockchain**. The node adds this new block to the end of the chain, making the blockchain longer with a new height of 277,315.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following shows blocks linked in a chain by reference to the previous block header hash:\n",
    "![](./Images/BlockLinkedUsingBlockHash.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Merkle Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Each block in the bitcoin blockchain contains a summary of all the transactions in the block using a merkle tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A merkle tree, also known as a balanced binary hash tree, is a data structure used for efficiently summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data. Merkle trees are binary trees containing cryptographic hashes.** The term \"tree\" is used in computer science to describe a branching data structure, but these trees are usually displayed upside down with the \"root\" at the top and the \"leaves\" at the bottom of a diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merkle trees are used in bitcoin to summarize all the transactions in a block, producing an overall digital fingerprint of the entire set of transactions**, providing a very efficient process to verify whether a transaction is included in a block. **A merkle tree is constructed by recursively hashing pairs of nodes until there is only one hash, called the root, or merkle root.** The cryptographic hash algorithm used in bitcoin’s merkle trees is SHA256 applied twice, also known as **double-SHA256.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **When N data elements are hashed and summarized in a merkle tree, you can check to see if any one data element is included in the tree with at most $2 \\times log_{2}(N)$ calculations**, making this a very efficient data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructing Merkle Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**The merkle tree is constructed bottom-up**. In the following example, we start with four transactions, A, B, C, and D, which form the leaves of the merkle tree, as shown in Calculating the nodes in a merkle tree. **The transactions are not stored in the merkle tree; rather, their data is hashed and the resulting hash is stored in each leaf node as HA, HB, HC, and HD:**<br>\n",
    "`HA = SHA256(SHA256(Transaction A))` where, HA represents Hash (double SHA-256) of transaction A\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/CalNodesInMerkleTree.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consecutive pairs of leaf nodes are then summarized in a parent node, by concatenating the two hashes and hashing them together**. For example, to construct the parent node HAB, the two 32-byte hashes of the children are concatenated to create a 64-byte string. That string is then double-hashed to produce the parent node’s hash:<br>\n",
    "`HAB = SHA256(SHA256(HA + HB))`\n",
    "\n",
    "**The process continues until there is only one node at the top, the node known as the merkle root. That 32-byte hash is stored in the block header and summarizes all the data in all four transactions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the merkle tree is a balanced binary tree, it needs an even number of leaf nodes. **If there is an odd number of transactions to summarize, the last transaction hash will be duplicated to create an even number of leaf nodes, also known as a balanced tree**. This is shown in the image below, where transaction C is duplicated:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/DuplicatingData2Balance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The same method for constructing a tree from four transactions can be generalized to construct trees of any size**. In bitcoin it is common to have several hundred to more than a thousand transactions in a single block, which are summarized in exactly the same way, producing just 32 bytes of data as the single merkle root. In the image below, you will see a tree built from 16 transactions. Note that although the root looks bigger than the leaf nodes in the diagram, it is the exact same size, just 32 bytes. Whether there is one transaction or a hundred thousand transactions in the block, the merkle root always summarizes them into 32 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/16TransacMerkleTree.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that a specific transaction is included in a block, a node only needs to produce $log_{2}(N)$ 32-byte hashes, constituting an **\"authentication path\"** or **\"merkle path\"** connecting the specific transaction to the root of the tree. This is especially important as the number of transactions increases, because the base-2 logarithm of the number of transactions increases much more slowly. **This allows bitcoin nodes to efficiently produce paths of 10 or 12 hashes (320–384 bytes), which can provide proof of a single transaction out of more than a thousand transactions in a megabyte-sized block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/MerklePathProvingK.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, **a node can prove that a transaction `K` is included in the block by producing a merkle path that is only four 32-byte hashes long (128 bytes total)**. The path consists of the four hashes (shown with a shaded background in the diagram) `HL`, `HIJ`, `HMNOP`, and `HABCDEFGH`. **With those four hashes provided as an authentication path, any node can prove that `HK` (with a black background at the bottom of the diagram) is included in the merkle root by computing four additional pair-wise hashes `HKL`, `HIJKL`, `HIJKLMNOP`, and the merkle tree root** (outlined in a dashed line in the diagram).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of merkle trees becomes obvious as the scale increases. Following Table shows the amount of data that needs to be exchanged as a merkle path to prove that a transaction is part of a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/MerkleTreeEfficiency.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the table, while the block size increases rapidly, from 4 KB with 16 transactions to a block size of 16 MB to fit 65,535 transactions, **the merkle path required to prove the inclusion of a transaction increases much more slowly**, from 128 bytes to only 512 bytes. **With merkle trees, a node can download just the block headers (80 bytes per block) and still be able to identify a transaction’s inclusion in a block by retrieving a small merkle path from a full node, without storing or transmitting the vast majority of the blockchain, which might be several gigabytes in size**. Nodes that do not maintain a full blockchain, called simplified payment verification (SPV) nodes, use merkle paths to verify transactions without downloading full blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Merkle Trees and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)\n",
    "\n",
    "Merkle trees are used extensively by SPV nodes. SPV nodes don’t have all transactions and do not download full blocks, just block headers. **In order to verify that a transaction is included in a block, without having to download all the transactions in the block, they use an authentication path, or merkle path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an **SPV node that is interested in incoming payments to an address contained in its wallet**, what it will do is:\n",
    "- The **SPV node will establish a bloom filter on its connections to peers to limit the transactions received to only those containing addresses of interest**.<br><br> \n",
    "- When a peer sees a transaction that matches the bloom filter, it will send that block using a **merkleblock** message. **The merkleblock message contains the block header as well as a merkle path that links the transaction of interest to the merkle root in the block**. <br><br> \n",
    "- The **SPV node can use this merkle path to connect the transaction to the block and verify that the transaction is included in the block**.<br><br> \n",
    "- The SPV node also uses the block header to link the block to the rest of the blockchain. **The combination of these two links, between the transaction and block, and between the block and blockchain, proves that the transaction is recorded in the blockchain. **\n",
    "\n",
    "**All in all, the SPV node will have received less than a kilobyte of data for the block header and merkle path, an amount of data that is more than a thousand times less than a full block** (about 1 megabyte currently).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin’s Test Blockchains\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be surprised to learn that there is **more than one bitcoin blockchain**. **The \"main\" bitcoin blockchain, the one created by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3rd, 2009, the one with the genesis block**, is called **\"mainnet\"**. There are other bitcoin blockchains that are used for testing purposes: at this time **testnet**, **segnet**, and **regtest**. Let’s look at each in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testnet: Bitcoin’s Testing Playground\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testnet is the name of the test blockchain, network, and currency that is used for testing purposes. The testnet is a fully featured live P2P network, with wallets, test bitcoins (testnet coins), mining, and all the other features of mainnet.** There are really only two differences:\n",
    "- testnet coins are meant to be worthless\n",
    "- mining difficulty should be low enough that anyone can mine testnet coins relatively easily (keeping them worthless).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any software development that is intended for production use on bitcoin’s mainnet should first be tested on testnet with test coins.** This protects both the developers from monetary losses due to bugs and the network from unintended behavior due to bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the coins worthless and the mining easy, however, is not easy. **Despite pleas from developers, some people use advanced mining equipment (GPUs and ASICs) to mine on testnet. This increases the difficulty, makes it impossible to mine with a CPU, and eventually makes it difficult enough to get test coins that people start valuing them, so they’re not worthless. As a result, every now and then, the testnet has to be scrapped and restarted from a new genesis block, resetting the difficulty**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current testnet is called **testnet3**, the third iteration of testnet, restarted in February 2011 to reset the difficulty from the previous testnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep in mind that testnet3 is a large blockchain, in excess of 20 GB in early 2017**. It will take a day or so to sync fully and use up resources on your computer. Not as much as mainnet, but not exactly \"lightweight\" either. One good way to run a testnet node is as a virtual machine image (e.g., VirtualBox, Docker, Cloud Server, etc.) dedicated for that purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In early 2017, testnet3 supports all the features of mainnet, including Segregated Witness. Therefore, testnet3 can also be used to test Segregated Witness features.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Since segwit was added to testnet3, it is no longer necessary to use segnet for testing of segwit features.\n",

    "**Regtest, which stands for \"Regression Testing,\" is a Bitcoin Core feature that allows you to create a local blockchain for testing purposes. Unlike testnet3, which is a public and shared test blockchain, the regtest blockchains are intended to be run as closed systems for local testing**.

    "# Mining and Consensus\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"mining\" is somewhat misleading. By evoking the extraction of precious metals, it focuses our attention on the reward for mining, the new bitcoin created in each block. Although mining is incentivized by this reward, the primary purpose of mining is not the reward or the generation of new coins. **If you view mining only as the process by which coins are created, you are mistaking the means (incentives) as the goal of the process. Mining is the mechanism that underpins the decentralized clearinghouse, by which transactions are validated and cleared. Mining is the invention that makes bitcoin special, a decentralized security mechanism that is the basis for P2P digital cash.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mining secures the bitcoin system and enables the emergence of network-wide consensus without a central authority**. The reward of **newly minted coins and transaction fees is an incentive scheme** that aligns the actions of miners with the security of the network, **while simultaneously implementing the monetary supply**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The purpose of mining is not the creation of new bitcoin. That’s the incentive system. Mining is the mechanism by which bitcoin’s security is decentralized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Miners validate new transactions and record them on the global ledger. **A new block, containing transactions that occurred since the last block, is \"mined\" every 10 minutes on average, thereby adding those transactions to the blockchain.** Transactions that become part of a block and added to the blockchain are considered **\"confirmed,\" which allows the new owners of bitcoin to spend the bitcoin they received in those transactions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Miners receive **two types of rewards in return for the security provided by mining**: \n",
    "- new coins created with each new block\n",
    "- transaction fees from all the transactions included in the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To earn this reward, miners compete to solve a difficult mathematical problem based on a cryptographic hash algorithm. The solution to the problem, called the Proof-of-Work, is included in the new block and acts as proof that the miner expended significant computing effort**. The competition to solve the Proof-of-Work algorithm to earn the reward and the right to record transactions on the blockchain is the basis for bitcoin’s security model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The process is called mining because the reward (new coin generation) is designed to simulate diminishing returns, just like mining for precious metals**. Bitcoin’s money supply is created through mining, similar to how a central bank issues new money by printing bank notes. **The maximum amount of newly created bitcoin a miner can add to a block decreases approximately every four years (or precisely every 210,000 blocks)**. It started at 50 bitcoin per block in January of 2009 and halved to 25 bitcoin per block in November of 2012. It halved again to 12.5 bitcoin in July 2016. Based on this formula, bitcoin mining rewards decrease exponentially until approximately the year 2140, when all bitcoin (20.99999998 million) will have been issued. After 2140, no new bitcoin will be issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin miners also earn fees from transactions. Every transaction may include a transaction fee, in the form of a surplus of bitcoin between the transaction’s inputs and outputs. The winning bitcoin miner gets to \"keep the change\" on the transactions included in the winning block**. Today, the fees represent 0.5% or less of a bitcoin miner’s income, the vast majority coming from the newly minted bitcoin. However, as the reward decreases over time and the number of transactions per block increases, a greater proportion of bitcoin mining earnings will come from fees. Gradually, the mining reward will be dominated by transaction fees, which will form the primary incentive for miners. **After 2140, the amount of new bitcoin in each block drops to zero and bitcoin mining will be incentivized only by transaction fees.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will first examine mining:\n",
    "- as a **monetary supply mechanism**\n",
    "- and then look at the most important function of mining: **the decentralized consensus mechanism that underpins bitcoin’s security**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand mining and consensus, we will follow Alice’s transaction as it is received and added to a block by Jing’s mining equipment. Then we will follow the block as it is mined, added to the blockchain, and accepted by the bitcoin network through the process of emergent consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Economics and Currency Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin are \"mined\" during the creation of each block at a fixed and diminishing rate**. Each block, generated on average every 10 minutes, contains entirely new bitcoin, created from nothing. Every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years, the currency issuance rate is decreased by 50%. For the first four years of operation of the network, each block contained 50 new bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In November 2012, the new bitcoin issuance rate was decreased to 25 bitcoin per block. In July of 2016 it was decreased again to 12.5 bitcoin per block. It will halve again to 6.25 bitcoin at block 630,000, which will be mined sometime in 2020. The rate of new coins decreases like this exponentially over 32 \"halvings\" until block 6,720,000 (mined approximately in year 2137), when it reaches the minimum currency unit of 1 satoshi. Finally, after 6.93 million blocks, in approximately 2140, almost 2,099,999,997,690,000 satoshis, or almost 21 million bitcoin, will be issued. Thereafter, blocks will contain no new bitcoin, and miners will be rewarded solely through the transaction fees. Following shows the total bitcoin in circulation over time, as the issuance of currency decreases:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/SupplyOfBTC.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The maximum number of coins mined is the upper limit of possible mining rewards for bitcoin. In practice, a miner may intentionally mine a block taking less than the full reward. Such blocks have already been mined and more may be mined in the future, resulting in a lower total issuance of the currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The finite and diminishing issuance creates a fixed monetary supply that resists inflation**. Unlike a fiat currency, which can be printed in infinite numbers by a central bank, bitcoin can never be inflated by printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deflationary Money\n",
    "\n",
    "**The most important and debated consequence of fixed and diminishing monetary issuance is that the currency tends to be inherently deflationary. Deflation is the phenomenon of appreciation of value due to a mismatch in supply and demand that drives up the value (and exchange rate) of a currency**. The opposite of inflation, price deflation, means that the money has more purchasing power over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many economists argue that a deflationary economy is a disaster that should be avoided at all costs. That is because in a period of rapid deflation, people tend to hoard money instead of spending it, hoping that prices will fall. Such a phenomenon unfolded during Japan’s \"Lost Decade,\" when a complete collapse of demand pushed the currency into a deflationary spiral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin experts argue that deflation is not bad per se. Rather, deflation is associated with a collapse in demand because that is the only example of deflation we have to study. In a fiat currency with the possibility of unlimited printing, it is very difficult to enter a deflationary spiral unless there is a complete collapse in demand and an unwillingness to print money. Deflation in bitcoin is not caused by a collapse in demand, but by a predictably constrained supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The positive aspect of deflation, of course, is that it is the opposite of inflation. Inflation causes a slow but inevitable debasement of currency, resulting in a form of hidden taxation that punishes savers in order to bail out debtors (including the biggest debtors, governments themselves)**. Currencies under government control suffer from the moral hazard of easy debt issuance that can later be erased through debasement at the expense of savers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It remains to be seen whether the deflationary aspect of the currency is a problem when it is not driven by rapid economic retraction, or an advantage because the protection from inflation and debasement far outweighs the risks of deflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decentralized Consensus\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we looked at the blockchain, **the global public ledger (list) of all transactions, which everyone in the bitcoin network accepts as the authoritative record of ownership.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**But how can everyone in the network agree on a single universal \"truth\" about who owns what, without having to trust anyone?** All traditional payment systems depend on a trust model that has a central authority providing a clearinghouse service, basically verifying and clearing all transactions. **Bitcoin has no central authority, yet somehow every full node has a complete copy of a public ledger that it can trust as the authoritative record**. The blockchain is not created by a central authority, but is assembled independently by every node in the network. Somehow, every node in the network, acting on information transmitted across insecure network connections, can arrive at the same conclusion and assemble a copy of the same public ledger as everyone else. In this section examines the process by which the bitcoin network achieves global consensus without central authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Satoshi Nakamoto’s main invention is the \"decentralized mechanism for emergent consensus\". Emergent, because consensus is not achieved explicitly—there is no election or fixed moment when consensus occurs. Instead, consensus is an emergent artifact of the asynchronous interaction of thousands of independent nodes, all following simple rules**. All the properties of bitcoin, including currency, transactions, payments, and the security model that does not depend on central authority or trust, derive from this invention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin’s decentralized consensus emerges from the interplay of four processes that occur independently on nodes across the network:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent verification of each transaction**, by every full node, based on a comprehensive list of criteria <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent aggregation of those transactions into new blocks by mining nodes, coupled with demonstrated computation through a Proof-of-Work algorithm** <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent verification of the new blocks by every node and assembly into a chain**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent selection, by every node, of the chain with the most cumulative computation demonstrated through Proof-of-Work**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections we will examine these processes and how they interact to create the emergent property of network-wide consensus that allows any bitcoin node to assemble its own copy of the authoritative, trusted, public, global ledger.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Independent Verification of Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Earlier we saw how wallet software creates transactions by collecting UTXO, providing the unlocking scripts corresponding to the UTXO, and then constructing new outputs assigned to a new owner. The resulting transaction is then sent to the neighboring nodes in the bitcoin network so that it can be propagated across the entire bitcoin network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before forwarding transactions to its neighbors, **every bitcoin node that receives a transaction will first verify the transaction. This ensures that only valid transactions are propagated across the network**, while invalid transactions are discarded at the first node that encounters them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node verifies every transaction against a long checklist of criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The transaction’s syntax and data structure must be correct.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neither lists of inputs or outputs are empty.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The transaction size in bytes is less than MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each output value, as well as the total, must be within the allowed range of values (less than 21m coins, more than the dust threshold).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- None of the inputs have hash=0, N=–1 (coinbase transactions should not be relayed).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- nLocktime is equal to INT_MAX, or nLocktime and nSequence values are satisfied according to MedianTimePast.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The transaction size in bytes is greater than or equal to 100.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of signature operations (SIGOPS) contained in the transaction is less than the signature operation limit.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The unlocking script (scriptSig) can only push numbers on the stack, and the locking script (scriptPubkey) must match IsStandard forms (this rejects \"nonstandard\" transactions).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A matching transaction in the pool, or in a block in the main branch, must exist.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each input, if the referenced output exists in any other transaction in the pool, the transaction must be rejected.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each input, look in the main branch and the transaction pool to find the referenced output transaction. If the output transaction is missing for any input, this<br><br> will be an orphan transaction. Add to the orphan transactions pool, if a matching transaction is not already in the pool.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each input, if the referenced output transaction is a coinbase output, it must have at least **COINBASE_MATURITY (100) confirmations**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each input, the referenced output must exist and cannot already be spent.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the referenced output transactions to get input values, check that each input value, as well as the sum, are in the allowed range of values (less than 21m coins, more than 0).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reject if the sum of input values is less than sum of output values.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reject if transaction fee would be too low (minRelayTxFee) to get into an empty block.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The unlocking scripts for each input must validate against the corresponding output locking scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions can be seen in detail in the functions AcceptToMemoryPool, CheckTransaction, and CheckInputs in Bitcoin Core. **Note that the conditions change over time, to address new types of denial-of-service attacks or sometimes to relax the rules so as to include more types of transactions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By independently verifying each transaction as it is received and before propagating it, every node builds a pool of valid (but unconfirmed) transactions known as the transaction pool, memory pool, or mempool.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mining Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the nodes on the bitcoin network are specialized nodes called miners. Earlier we introduced Jing, a computer engineering student in Shanghai, China, who is a bitcoin miner. Jing earns bitcoin by running a **\"mining rig,\" which is a specialized computer-hardware system designed to mine bitcoin. Jing’s specialized mining hardware is connected to a server running a full bitcoin node. Unlike Jing, some miners mine without a full node**, as we will see in Mining Pools. Like every other full node, Jing’s node receives and propagates unconfirmed transactions on the bitcoin network. Jing’s node, however, also aggregates these transactions into new blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jing’s node is listening for new blocks, propagated on the bitcoin network, as do all nodes. However, the arrival of a new block has special significance for a mining node. The competition among miners effectively ends with the propagation of a new block that acts as an announcement of a winner**. To miners, receiving a valid new block means someone else won the competition and they lost. However, the end of one round of a competition is also the beginning of the next round. **The new block is not just a checkered flag, marking the end of the race; it is also the starting pistol in the race for the next block**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Aggregating Transactions into Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**After validating transactions, a bitcoin node will add them to the memory pool, or transaction pool, where transactions await until they can be included (mined) into a block. Jing’s node collects, validates, and relays new transactions just like any other node. Unlike other nodes, however, Jing’s node will then aggregate these transactions into a candidate block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s follow the blocks that were created during the time Alice bought a cup of coffee from Bob’s Cafe. Alice’s transaction was included in block 277,316. For the purpose of demonstrating the concepts in this chapter, let’s assume that block was mined by Jing’s mining system and follows Alice’s transaction as it becomes part of this new block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jing’s mining node maintains a local copy of the blockchain. By the time Alice buys the cup of coffee, Jing’s node has assembled a chain up to block 277,314. Jing’s node is listening for transactions, trying to mine a new block and also listening for blocks discovered by other nodes. As Jing’s node is mining, it receives block 277,315 through the bitcoin network. The arrival of this block signifies the end of the competition for block 277,315 and the beginning of the competition to create block 277,316.\n",
    "\n",
    "**During the previous 10 minutes, while Jing’s node was searching for a solution to block 277,315, it was also collecting transactions in preparation for the next block. By now it has collected a few hundred transactions in the memory pool. Upon receiving block 277,315 and validating it, Jing’s node will also compare it against all the transactions in the memory pool and remove any that were included in block 277,315.** Whatever transactions remain in the memory pool are unconfirmed and are waiting to be recorded in a new block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jing’s node immediately constructs a new empty block, a candidate for block 277,316. This block is called a candidate block because it is not yet a valid block, as it does not contain a valid Proof-of-Work. The block becomes valid only if the miner succeeds in finding a solution to the Proof-of-Work algorithm.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When Jing’s node aggregates all the transactions from the memory pool, the new candidate block has 418 transactions with total transaction fees of 0.09094928 bitcoin. We can see this block in the blockchain using the Bitcoin Core client command-line interface, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/RetrievingABlock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Coinbase Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first transaction in any block is a special transaction, called a coinbase transaction**. This transaction is constructed by Jing’s node and contains his reward for the mining effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When block 277,316 was mined, the reward was 25 bitcoin per block. Since then, one \"halving\" period has elapsed. The block reward changed to 12.5 bitcoin in July 2016. It will be halved again in 210,000 blocks, in the year 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jing’s node creates the coinbase transaction as a payment to his own wallet: \"Pay Jing’s address 25.09094928 bitcoin.\" T**he total amount of reward that Jing collects for mining a block is the sum of the coinbase reward (25 new bitcoin) and the transaction fees (0.09094928) from all the transactions included in the block** as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/CoinbaseTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular transactions, the coinbase transaction does not consume (spend) UTXO as inputs. **Instead, it has only one input, called the coinbase, which creates bitcoin from nothing. The coinbase transaction has one output, payable to the miner’s own bitcoin address**. The output of the coinbase transaction sends the value of 25.09094928 bitcoin to the miner’s bitcoin address; in this case it is `1MxTkeEP2PmHSMze5tUZ1hAV3YTKu2Gh1N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coinbase Reward and Fees\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the coinbase transaction, Jing’s node first calculates the **total amount of transaction fees by adding all the inputs and outputs of the 418 transactions that were added to the block**. The fees are calculated as:<br>\n",
    "`Total Fees = Sum(Inputs) - Sum(Outputs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In block 277,316, the total transaction fees are 0.09094928 bitcoin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Jing’s node calculates the correct reward for the new block. **The reward is calculated based on the block height, starting at 50 bitcoin per block and reduced by half every 210,000 blocks. Because this block is at height 277,316, the correct reward is 25 bitcoin.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">If Jing’s mining node writes the coinbase transaction, what stops Jing from \"rewarding\" himself 100 or 1000 bitcoin? The answer is that **an incorrect reward would result in the block being deemed invalid by everyone else, wasting Jing’s electricity used for Proof-of-Work. Jing only gets to spend the reward if the block is accepted by everyone.**\n",
    "\n",
    "With these calculations, Jing’s node then constructs the coinbase transaction to pay himself 25.09094928 bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Coinbase Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, the coinbase transaction has a special format. **Instead of a transaction input specifying a previous UTXO to spend, it has a \"coinbase\" input**. Let’s compare a regular transaction input with a coinbase transaction input. Following tables shows the structure of a regular transaction and the structure of the coinbase transaction’s input.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransacInput-Normal&Coinbase.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a coinbase transaction, the first two fields are set to values that do not represent a UTXO reference. **Instead of a \"transaction hash,\" the first field is filled with 32 bytes all set to zero. The \"output index\" is filled with 4 bytes all set to 0xFF (255 decimal). The \"Unlocking Script\" (scriptSig) is replaced by coinbase data**, a data field used by the miners, as we will see next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coinbase Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coinbase transactions do not have an unlocking script (aka, scriptSig) field. Instead, this field is replaced by coinbase data, which must be between 2 and 100 bytes**. Except for the first few bytes, the rest of the coinbase data can be used by miners in any way they want; it is arbitrary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the genesis block, for example, Satoshi Nakamoto added the text \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\" in the coinbase data, using it as a proof of the date and to convey a message**. Currently, miners use the coinbase data to include extra nonce values and strings identifying the mining pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few bytes of the coinbase used to be arbitrary, but that is no longer the case. **As per BIP-34, version-2 blocks (blocks with the version field set to 2) must contain the block height index as a script \"push\" operation in the beginning of the coinbase field.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In block 277,316, given below, we see that the coinbase, which is in the unlocking script or scriptSig field of the transaction input, contains the hexadecimal value `03443b0403858402062f503253482f`. Let’s decode this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/CoinbaseTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoding Coinbase Data:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first byte, `03`, instructs the script execution engine to push the next three bytes onto the script stack. The next three bytes, `0x443b04`, are the block height encoded in little-endian format (backward, least-significant byte first). Reverse the order of the bytes and the result is `0x043b44`, which is 277,316 in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few hexadecimal digits (`0385840206`) are used to encode an extra nonce (see The Extra Nonce Solution), or random value, used to find a suitable Proof-of-Work solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final part of the coinbase data (`2f503253482f`) is the ASCII-encoded string /P2SH/, which indicates that the mining node that mined this block supports the P2SH improvement defined in BIP-16. The introduction of the P2SH capability required signaling by miners to endorse either BIP-16 or BIP-17. Those endorsing the BIP-16 implementation were to include /P2SH/ in their coinbase data. Those endorsing the BIP-17 implementation of P2SH were to include the string p2sh/CHV in their coinbase data. The BIP-16 was elected as the winner, and many miners continued including the string /P2SH/ in their coinbase to indicate support for this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructing the Block Header\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the block header, the mining node needs to fill in six fields, as listed:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/StrucOfBlockHeader.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time that block 277,316 was mined, the version number describing the block structure is **version 2**, which is encoded in little-endian format in 4 bytes as 0x02000000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the mining node needs to add the **\"Previous Block Hash\"** (also known as prevhash). **That is the hash of the block header of block 277,315, the previous block received from the network, which Jing’s node has accepted and selected as the parent of the candidate block 277,316.** The block header hash for block 277,315 is:<br>\n",
    "`0000000000000002a7bbd25a417c0374cc55261021e8a9ca74442b01284f0569`\n",
    "\n",
    ">By selecting the specific parent block, indicated by the Previous Block Hash field in the candidate block header, Jing is committing his mining power to extending the chain that ends in that specific block. In essence, this is how Jing \"votes\" with his mining power for the longest-difficulty valid chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The next step is to summarize all the transactions with a Merkle tree**, in order to add the merkle root to the block header. The coinbase transaction is listed as the first transaction in the block. Then, 418 more transactions are added after it, for a total of 419 transactions in the block. As we under the Merkle Tree section, there must be an even number of \"leaf\" nodes in the tree, so the last transaction is duplicated, creating 420 nodes, each containing the hash of one transaction. The transaction hashes are then combined, in pairs, creating each level of the tree, until all the transactions are summarized into one node at the \"root\" of the tree. The root of the merkle tree summarizes all the transactions into a single 32-byte value.\n",

The hash function’s result cannot be determined in advance, nor can a pattern be created that will produce a specific hash value.

It took 13 attempts to find it. In terms of probabilities, if the output of the hash function is evenly distributed we would expect to find a result with a 0 as the hexadecimal prefix once every 16 hashes (one out of 16 hexadecimal digits 0 through F). \n",

Now, more than half the dice throws will exceed the target and therefore be invalid. It takes exponentially more dice throws to win, the lower the target gets. Eventually, when the target is 2 (the minimum possible), only one throw out of every 36, or 2% of them, will produce a winning result.\n",

While it only takes one hash computation to verify, it took us 13 hash computations to find a nonce that worked.** If we had a lower target (higher difficulty) it would take many more hash computations to find a suitable nonce, but only one hash computation for anyone to verify. Furthermore, **by knowing the target, anyone can estimate the difficulty using statistics and therefore know how much work was needed to find such a nonce.**\n",

If we think of the entire 256-bit number space, each time you constrain one more bit to zero, we decrease the valid hash space by half.** In the above example, it takes 84 million hash attempts to find a nonce that produces a hash with 26 leading bits as zero. Even at a speed of more than 120,000 hashes per second, it still requires 10 minutes on a laptop to find this solution.\n",

    "In the example below we can see that the block contains the target, in a notation called **\"target bits\"** or just **\"bits\"**, which in block 277,316 has the value of `0x1903a30c`. **This notation expresses the Proof-of-Work target as a coefficient/exponent format, with the first two hexadecimal digits for the exponent and the next six hex digits as the coefficient**.

    "This means that a valid block for height 277,316 is one that has a block header hash that is less than the target. In binary that number must have more than 60 leading bits set to zero. **With this level of difficulty, a single miner processing 1 trillion hashes per second (1 terahash per second or 1 TH/sec) would only find a solution once every 8,496 blocks or once every 59 days, on average.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retargeting to Adjust Difficulty\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw, the target determines the difficulty and therefore affects how long it takes to find a solution to the Proof-of-Work algorithm. **This leads to the obvious questions: Why is the difficulty adjustable, who adjusts it, and how?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin’s blocks are generated every 10 minutes, on average. This is bitcoin’s heartbeat and underpins the frequency of currency issuance and the speed of transaction settlement. It has to remain constant not just over the short term, but over a period of many decades. Over this time, it is expected that computer power will continue to increase at a rapid pace. Furthermore, the number of participants in mining and the computers they use will also constantly change. **To keep the block generation time at 10 minutes, the difficulty of mining must be adjusted to account for these changes. In fact, the Proof-of-Work target is a dynamic parameter that is periodically adjusted to meet a 10-minute block interval goal. In simple terms, the target is set so that the current mining power will result in a 10-minute block interval.**\n",
    "\n",
    "How, then, is such an adjustment made in a completely decentralized network?<br>\n",
    "**Retargeting occurs automatically and on every node independently. Every 2,016 blocks, all nodes retarget the Proof-of-Work. The equation for retargeting measures the time it took to find the last 2,016 blocks and compares that to the expected time of 20,160 minutes (2,016 blocks times the desired 10-minute block interval). The ratio between the actual timespan and desired timespan is calculated and a proportionate adjustment (up or down) is made to the targe**t.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms: If the network is finding blocks faster than every 10 minutes, the difficulty increases (target decreases). If block discovery is slower than expected, the difficulty decreases (target increases).<br>\n",
    "The equation can be summarized as:<br>\n",
    "`New Target = Old Target * (Actual Time of Last 2016 Blocks / 20160 minutes)`\n",
    "\n",
    "> While the target calibration happens every 2,016 blocks, because of an off-by-one error in the original Bitcoin Core client it is based on the total time of the previous 2,015 blocks (not 2,016 as it should be), resulting in a retargeting bias toward higher difficulty by 0.05%\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid extreme volatility in the difficulty, **the retargeting adjustment must be less than a factor of four (4) per cycle. If the required target adjustment is greater than a factor of four, it will be adjusted by a factor of 4 and not more**. Any further adjustment will be accomplished in the next retargeting period because the imbalance will persist through the next 2,016 blocks. **Therefore, large discrepancies between hashing power and difficulty might take several 2,016 block cycles to balance out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block is approximately '10 minutes of processing' for the entire network, based on the time it took to mine the previous 2,016 blocks, adjusted every 2,016 blocks. This is achieved by lowering or raising the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **the target is independent of the number of transactions or the value of transactions. This means that the amount of hashing power and therefore electricity expended to secure bitcoin is also entirely independent of the number of transactions. Bitcoin can scale up, achieve broader adoption, and remain secure without any increase in hashing power from today’s level**. The increase in hashing power represents market forces as new miners enter the market to compete for the reward. As long as enough hashing power is under the control of miners acting honestly in pursuit of the reward, it is enough to prevent \"takeover\" attacks and, therefore, it is enough to secure bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The difficulty of mining is closely related to the cost of electricity and the exchange rate of bitcoin vis-a-vis the currency used to pay for electricity**. High-performance mining systems are about as efficient as possible with the current generation of silicon fabrication, converting electricity into hashing computation at the highest rate possible. **The primary influence on the mining market is the price of one kilowatt-hour of electricity in bitcoin, because that determines the profitability of mining and therefore the incentives to enter or exit the mining market.**\n",

    "### Successfully Mining the Block\n",

    "As we saw earlier, Jing’s node has constructed a candidate block and prepared it for mining. Jing has several hardware mining rigs with application-specific integrated circuits, where hundreds of thousands of integrated circuits run the SHA256 algorithm in parallel at incredible speeds. Many of these specialized machines are connected to his mining node over USB or a local area network. **Next, the mining node running on Jing’s desktop transmits the block header to his mining hardware, which starts testing trillions of nonces per second. Because the nonce is only 32 bits, after exhausting all the nonce possibilities (about 4 billion), the mining hardware changes the block header (adjusting the coinbase extra nonce space or timestamp) and resets the nonce counter, testing new combinations.**\n",

    "Immediately, Jing’s mining node transmits the block to all its peers. They receive, validate, and then propagate the new block. As the block ripples out across the network, each node adds it to its own copy of the blockchain, extending it to a new height of 277,316 blocks. **As mining nodes receive and validate the block, they abandon their efforts to find a block at the same height and immediately start computing the next block in the chain, using Jing’s block as the \"parent.\" By building on top of Jing’s newly discovered block, the other miners are essentially \"voting\" with their mining power and endorsing Jing’s block and the chain it extends.**\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. Validating a New Block\n",
    "\n",
    "The third step in bitcoin’s consensus mechanism is independent validation of each new block by every node on the network. **As the newly solved block moves across the network, each node performs a series of tests to validate it before propagating it to its peers. This ensures that only valid blocks are propagated on the network.** The independent validation also ensures that miners who act honestly get their blocks incorporated in the blockchain, thus earning the reward. **Those miners who act dishonestly have their blocks rejected and not only lose the reward, but also waste the effort expended to find a Proof-of-Work solution, thus incurring the cost of electricity without compensation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a node receives a new block, **it will validate the block by checking it against a long list of criteria that must all be met; otherwise, the block is rejected**. These criteria can be seen in the Bitcoin Core client in the functions CheckBlock and CheckBlockHeader and include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The block data structure is syntactically valid\n",
    "\n",
    "- The block header hash is less than the target (enforces the Proof-of-Work)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The block timestamp is less than two hours in the future (allowing for time errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The block size is within acceptable limits\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first transaction (and only the first) is a coinbase transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "- All transactions within the block are valid using the transaction checklist discussed in Independent Verification of Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent validation of each new block by every node on the network ensures that the miners cannot cheat. In previous sections we saw how miners get to write a transaction that awards them the new bitcoin created within the block and claim the transaction fees. **Why don’t miners write themselves a transaction for a thousand bitcoin instead of the correct reward? Because every node validates blocks according to the same rules. An invalid coinbase transaction would make the entire block invalid, which would result in the block being rejected and, therefore, that transaction would never become part of the ledger**. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The miners have to construct a perfect block, based on the shared rules that all nodes follow, and mine it with a correct solution to the Proof-of-Work. To do so, they expend a lot of electricity in mining, and **if they cheat, all the electricity and effort is wasted. This is why independent validation is a key component of decentralized consensus.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Assembling and Selecting Chains of Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in bitcoin’s decentralized consensus mechanism is the assembly of blocks into chains and the selection of the chain with the most Proof-of-Work. **Once a node has validated a new block, it will then attempt to assemble a chain by connecting the block to the existing blockchain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes maintain three sets of blocks**: \n",
    "- those connected to the main blockchain \n",
    "- those that form branches off the main blockchain (secondary chains), \n",
    "- and finally, blocks that do not have a known parent in the known chains (orphans).\n",
    "\n",
    "Invalid blocks are rejected as soon as any one of the validation criteria fails and are therefore not included in any chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"main chain\" at any time is whichever valid chain of blocks has the most cumulative Proof-of-Work associated with it. In other words, the longest chain is the main chain.** Under most circumstances this is also the chain with the most blocks in it, unless there are two equal-length chains and one has more Proof-of-Work. **The main chain will also have branches with blocks that are \"siblings\" to the blocks on the main chain. These blocks are valid but not part of the main chain. They are kept for future reference, in case one of those chains is extended to exceed the main chain in work**. In the next section (Blockchain Forks), we will see how secondary chains occur as a result of an almost simultaneous mining of blocks at the same height.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When a new block is received, a node will try to slot it into the existing blockchain. The node will look at the block’s \"previous block hash\" field, which is the reference to the block’s parent. Then, the node will attempt to find that parent in the existing blockchain. Most of the time, the parent will be the \"tip\" of the main chain, meaning this new block extends the main chain**. For example, the new block 277,316 has a reference to the hash of its parent block 277,315. Most nodes that receive 277,316 will already have block 277,315 as the tip of their main chain and will therefore link the new block and extend that chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sometimes, as we will see in Blockchain Forks, the new block extends a chain that is not the main chain. In that case, the node will attach the new block to the secondary chain it extends and then compare the work of the secondary chain to the main chain. If the secondary chain has more cumulative work than the main chain, the node will reconverge on the secondary chain, meaning it will select the secondary chain as its new main chain, making the old main chain a secondary chain.** If the node is a miner, it will now construct a block extending this new, longer, chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If a valid block is received and no parent is found in the existing chains, that block is considered an \"orphan.\" Orphan blocks are saved in the orphan block pool where they will stay until their parent is received. Once the parent is received and linked into the existing chains, the orphan can be pulled out of the orphan pool and linked to the parent**, making it part of a chain. Orphan blocks usually occur when two blocks that were mined within a short time of each other are received in reverse order (child before parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "**By selecting the \"greatest-cumulative-work\" valid chain, all nodes eventually achieve network-wide consensus. Temporary discrepancies between chains are resolved eventually as more work is added, extending one of the possible chains**. Mining nodes \"vote\" with their mining power by choosing which chain to extend by mining the next block. **When they mine a new block and extend the chain, the new block itself represents their vote.**\n",

    "### Blockchain Forks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because the blockchain is a decentralized data structure, different copies of it are not always consistent. Blocks might arrive at different nodes at different times, causing the nodes to have different perspectives of the blockchain**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To resolve this, each node always selects and attempts to extend the chain of blocks that represents the most Proof-of-Work, also known as the longest chain or greatest cumulative work chain**. By summing the work recorded in each block in a chain, a node can calculate the total amount of work that has been expended to create that chain. **As long as all nodes select the greatest-cumulative-work chain, the global bitcoin network eventually converges to a consistent state.** Forks occur as temporary inconsistencies between versions of the blockchain, which are resolved by eventual reconvergence as more blocks are added to one of the forks.\n",

In 2013 the introduction of \"ASIC\" mining lead to another giant leap in mining power, by placing the SHA256 function directly on silicon chips specialized for the purpose of mining.** The first such chips could deliver more mining power in a single box than the entire bitcoin network in 2010.\n",

There are no more giant leaps left in bitcoin mining, because the industry has reached the forefront of Moore’s Law**, which stipulates that computing density will double approximately every 18 months. Still, the mining power of the network continues to advance at an exponential pace as the race for higher density chips is matched with a race for higher density data centers where thousands of these chips can be deployed. \n",

    "### The Extra Nonce Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2012, bitcoin mining has evolved to resolve a fundamental limitation in the structure of the block header. **In the early days of bitcoin, a miner could find a block by iterating through the nonce until the resulting hash was below the target. As difficulty increased, miners often cycled through all 4 billion values of the nonce without finding a block. However, this was easily resolved by updating the block timestamp to account for the elapsed time**. Because the timestamp is part of the header, the change would allow miners to iterate through the values of the nonce again with different results. **Once mining hardware exceeded 4 GH/sec, however, this approach became increasingly difficult because the nonce values were exhausted in less than a second. As ASIC mining equipment started pushing and then exceeding the TH/sec hash rate, the mining software needed more space for nonce values in order to find valid blocks**. The timestamp could be stretched a bit, but moving it too far into the future would cause the block to become invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A new source of \"change\" was needed in the block header. The solution was to use the \"coinbase transaction as a source of extra nonce values\". Because the coinbase script can store between 2 and 100 bytes of data, miners started using that space as extra nonce space, allowing them to explore a much larger range of block header values to find valid block**s. The coinbase transaction is included in the merkle tree, which means that any change in the coinbase script causes the merkle root to change. **Eight bytes of extra nonce, plus the 4 bytes of \"standard\" nonce allow miners to explore a total $2^{96}$ (8 followed by 28 zeros) possibilities per second without having to modify the timestamp. If, in the future, miners could run through all these possibilities, they could then modify the timestamp. There is also more space in the coinbase script for future expansion of the extra nonce space.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mining Pools\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this highly competitive environment, individual miners working alone (also known as solo miners) don’t stand a chance. The likelihood of them finding a block to offset their electricity and hardware costs is so low that it represents a gamble**, like playing the lottery. Even the fastest consumer ASIC mining system cannot keep up with commercial systems that stack tens of thousands of these chips in giant warehouses near hydroelectric powerstations. **Miners now collaborate to form mining pools, pooling their hashing power and sharing the reward among thousands of participants. By participating in a pool, miners get a smaller share of the overall reward, but typically get rewarded every day, reducing uncertainty.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a specific example:<br>\n",
    "Assume a miner has purchased mining hardware with a combined hashing rate of 14,000 gigahashes per second (GH/s), or 14 TH/s. In 2017 this equipment costs approximately $\\$$2,500 USD. The hardware consumes 1375 watts (1.3 kW) of electricity when running, 33 kW-hours a day, at a cost of $\\$$1 to $\\$$2 per day at very low electricity rates. **At current bitcoin difficulty, the miner will be able to solo mine a block approximately once every 4 years**. How do we work out that probability?<br>\n",
    "It is based on a network-wide hashing rate of 3 EH/sec (in 2017), and the miner’s rate of 14 TH/sec:\n",
    "\n",
    "P = $(14 * 10^{12} / 3 * 10^{18}) * 210240 = 0.98$\n",
    "\n",
    "…​where 21240 is the number of blocks in four years. The miner has a 98% probability of finding a block over four years, based on the global hash rate at the beginning of the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the miner does find a single block in that timeframe, the payout of 12.5 bitcoin, at approximately $\\$$1,000 per bitcoin, will result in a single payout of $\\$$12,500, which will produce a net profit of about $\\$$7,000. However, the chance of finding a block in a 4-year period depends on the miner’s luck. He might find two blocks in 4 years and make a very large profit. Or he might not find a block for 5 years and suffer a bigger financial loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Even worse, the difficulty of the bitcoin Proof-of-Work algorithm is likely to go up significantly over that period, at the current rate of growth of hashing power, meaning the miner has, at most, one year to break even before the hardware is effectively obsolete and must be replaced by more powerful mining hardware. If this miner participates in a mining pool, instead of waiting for a once-in-four-years $\\$$12,500 windfall, he will be able to earn approximately $\\$$50 to $\\$$60 per week**. The regular payouts from a mining pool will help him amortize the cost of hardware and electricity over time without taking an enormous risk. The hardware will still be obsolete in one or two years and the risk is still high, but the revenue is at least regular and reliable over that period. Financially this only makes sense at very low electricity cost (less than 1 cent per kW-hour) and only at very large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mining pools coordinate many hundreds or thousands of miners, over specialized pool-mining protocols. The individual miners configure their mining equipment to connect to a pool server, after creating an account with the pool. Their mining hardware remains connected to the pool server while mining, synchronizing their efforts with the other miners**. Thus, the pool miners share the effort to mine a block and then share in the rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful blocks pay the reward to a pool bitcoin address, rather than individual miners. **The pool server will periodically make payments to the miners' bitcoin addresses, once their share of the rewards has reached a certain threshold. Typically, the pool server charges a percentage fee of the rewards for providing the pool-mining service.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Miners participating in a pool split the work of searching for a solution to a candidate block, earning \"shares\" for their mining contribution**. The mining pool sets a higher target (lower difficulty) for earning a share, typically more than 1,000 times easier than the bitcoin network’s target. When someone in the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is earned by the pool and then shared with all miners in proportion to the number of shares they contributed to the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pools are open to any miner, big or small, professional or amateur. A pool will therefore have some participants with a single small mining machine, and others with a garage full of high-end mining hardware. Some will be mining with a few tens of a kilowatt of electricity, others will be running a data center consuming a megawatt of power. **How does a mining pool measure the individual contributions, so as to fairly distribute the rewards, without the possibility of cheating?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The answer is to use bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work algorithm to measure each pool miner’s contribution, but set at a lower difficulty so that even the smallest pool miners win a share frequently enough to make it worthwhile to contribute to the pool. By setting a lower difficulty for earning shares, the pool measures the amount of work done by each miner. Each time a pool miner finds a block header hash that is less than the pool target, she proves she has done the hashing work to find that result**. \n",
    "> More importantly, **the work to find shares contributes, in a statistically measurable way, to the overall effort to find a hash lower than the bitcoin network’s target.** Thousands of miners trying to find low-value hashes will eventually find one low enough to satisfy the bitcoin network target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s return to the analogy of a dice game. If the dice players are throwing dice with a goal of throwing less than four (the overall network difficulty), a pool would set an easier target, counting how many times the pool players managed to throw less than eight. When pool players throw less than eight (the pool share target), they earn shares, but they don’t win the game because they don’t achieve the game target (less than four). T**he pool players will achieve the easier pool target much more often, earning them shares very regularly, even when they don’t achieve the harder target of winning the game. Every now and then, one of the pool players will throw a combined dice throw of less than four and the pool wins. Then, the earnings can be distributed to the pool players based on the shares they earned**. Even though the target of eight-or-less wasn’t winning, it was a fair way to measure dice throws for the players, and it occasionally produces a less-than-four throw.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similarly, **a mining pool will set a (higher and easier) pool target that will ensure that an individual pool miner can find block header hashes that are less than the pool target often, earning shares. Every now and then, one of these attempts will produce a block header hash that is less than the bitcoin network target, making it a valid block and the whole pool wins**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managed pools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most mining pools are \"managed,\" meaning that there is a company or individual running a pool server. The owner of the pool server is called the pool operator, and he charges pool miners a percentage fee of the earnings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pool server runs specialized software and a pool-mining protocol that coordinate the activities of the pool miners. The pool server is also connected to one or more full bitcoin nodes and has direct access to a full copy of the blockchain database. This allows the pool server to validate blocks and transactions on behalf of the pool miners, relieving them of the burden of running a full node. For pool miners, this is an important consideration, because a full node requires a dedicated computer with at least 100 to 150 GB of persistent storage (disk) and at least 2 to 4 GB of memory (RAM)**. Furthermore, the bitcoin software running on the full node needs to be monitored, maintained, and upgraded frequently. Any downtime caused by a lack of maintenance or lack of resources will hurt the miner’s profitability. For many miners, the ability to mine without running a full node is another big benefit of joining a managed pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pool miners connect to the pool server using a mining protocol such as Stratum (STM) or GetBlockTemplate (GBT)**. An older standard called **GetWork (GWK) has been mostly obsolete** since late 2012, because it does not easily support mining at hash rates above 4 GH/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both the STM and GBT protocols create block templates that contain a template of a candidate block header. The pool server constructs a candidate block by aggregating transactions, adding a coinbase transaction (with extra nonce space), calculating the merkle root, and linking to the previous block hash. The header of the candidate block is then sent to each of the pool miners as a template. Each pool miner then mines using the block template, at a higher (easier) target than the bitcoin network target, and sends any successful results back to the pool server to earn shares.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Peer-to-peer mining pool (P2Pool)\n",
    "\n",
    "Managed pools create the possibility of **cheating by the pool operator**, who might direct the pool effort to double-spend transactions or invalidate blocks (see Consensus Attacks). Furthermore, **centralized pool servers represent a single-point-of-failure.** If the pool server is down or is slowed by a denial-of-service attack, the pool miners cannot mine. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2011, to resolve these issues of centralization, a new pool mining method was proposed and implemented: **P2Pool, a peer-to-peer mining pool without a central operator.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**P2Pool works by decentralizing the functions of the pool server, implementing a parallel blockchain-like system called a share chain. A share chain is a blockchain running at a lower difficulty than the bitcoin blockchain.** The share chain allows pool miners to collaborate in a decentralized pool by mining shares on the share chain at a rate of one share block every 30 seconds. Each of the blocks on the share chain records a proportionate share reward for the pool miners who contribute work, carrying the shares forward from the previous share block. **When one of the share blocks also achieves the bitcoin network target, it is propagated and included on the bitcoin blockchain, rewarding all the pool miners who contributed to all the shares that preceded the winning share block**. \n",
    "> Essentially, instead of a pool server keeping track of pool miner shares and rewards, the share chain allows all pool miners to keep track of all shares using a decentralized consensus mechanism like bitcoin’s blockchain consensus mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**P2Pool mining is more complex than pool mining because it requires that the pool miners run a dedicated computer with enough disk space, memory, and internet bandwidth to support a full bitcoin node and the P2Pool node software**. P2Pool miners connect their mining hardware to their local P2Pool node, which simulates the functions of a pool server by sending block templates to the mining hardware. On P2Pool, individual pool miners construct their own candidate blocks, aggregating transactions much like solo miners, but then mine collaboratively on the share chain. P2Pool is a hybrid approach that has the advantage of much more granular payouts than solo mining, but without giving too much control to a pool operator like managed pools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Even though P2Pool reduces the concentration of power by mining pool operators, it is conceivably vulnerable to 51% attacks against the share chain itself.** A much broader adoption of P2Pool does not solve the 51% attack problem for bitcoin itself. Rather, P2Pool makes bitcoin more robust overall, as part of a diversified mining ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consensus Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism is, at least theoretically, vulnerable to attack by miners (or pools) that attempt to use their hashing power to dishonest or destructive ends. As we saw, the consensus mechanism depends on having a majority of the miners acting honestly out of self-interest. However, **if a miner or group of miners can achieve a significant share of the mining power, they can attack the consensus mechanism so as to disrupt the security and availability of the bitcoin network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important to note that consensus attacks can only affect future consensus, or at best, the most recent past (tens of blocks)**. Bitcoin’s ledger becomes more and more immutable as time passes. While in theory, a fork can be achieved at any depth, in practice, the computing power needed to force a very deep fork is immense, making old blocks practically immutable. Consensus attacks also do not affect the security of the private keys and signing algorithm (ECDSA). **A consensus attack cannot steal bitcoin, spend bitcoin without signatures, redirect bitcoin, or otherwise change past transactions or ownership records. Consensus attacks can only affect the most recent blocks and cause denial-of-service disruptions on the creation of future blocks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One attack scenario against the consensus mechanism is called the **\"51% attack\"**. In this scenario a group of miners, controlling a majority (51%) of the total network’s hashing power, collude to attack bitcoin. **With the ability to mine the majority of the blocks, the attacking miners can cause deliberate \"forks\" in the blockchain and cause the following 2 type of attacks:**\n",
    "- Double-spend transactions \n",
    "- Denial-of-service attacks against specific transactions or addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double-Spend Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "**A fork/double-spend attack is where the attacker causes previously confirmed blocks to be invalidated by forking below them and re-converging on an alternate chain. With sufficient power, an attacker can invalidate six or more blocks in a row, causing transactions that were considered immutable (six confirmations) to be invalidated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note that a double-spend can only be done on the attacker’s own transactions, for which the attacker can produce a valid signature.** Double-spending one’s own transactions is profitable if by invalidating a transaction the attacker can get an irreversible exchange payment or product without paying for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we looked at a transaction between Alice and Bob for a cup of coffee. Bob, the cafe owner, is willing to accept payment for cups of coffee without waiting for confirmation (mining in a block), because the risk of a double-spend on a cup of coffee is low in comparison to the convenience of rapid customer service. This is similar to the practice of coffee shops that accept credit card payments without a signature for amounts below $25, because the risk of a credit-card chargeback is low while the cost of delaying the transaction to obtain a signature is comparatively larger. In contrast, selling a more expensive item for bitcoin runs the risk of a double-spend attack, where the buyer broadcasts a competing transaction that spends the same inputs (UTXO) and cancels the payment to the merchant. **A double-spend attack can happen in two ways: either before a transaction is confirmed, or if the attacker takes advantage of a blockchain fork to undo several blocks. A 51% attack allows attackers to double-spend their own transactions in the new chain, thus undoing the corresponding transaction in the old chain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, malicious attacker Mallory goes to Carol’s gallery and purchases a beautiful triptych painting depicting Satoshi Nakamoto as Prometheus. Carol sells \"The Great Fire\" paintings for $250,000 in bitcoin to Mallory. Instead of waiting for six or more confirmations on the transaction, Carol wraps and hands the paintings to Mallory after only one confirmation. Mallory works with an accomplice, Paul, who operates a large mining pool, and the accomplice launches a 51% attack as soon as Mallory’s transaction is included in a block. **Paul directs the mining pool to remine the same block height as the block containing Mallory’s transaction, replacing Mallory’s payment to Carol with a transaction that double-spends the same input as Mallory’s payment. The double-spend transaction consumes the same UTXO and pays it back to Mallory’s wallet, instead of paying it to Carol, essentially allowing Mallory to keep the bitcoin. Paul then directs the mining pool to mine an additional block, so as to make the chain containing the double-spend transaction longer than the original chain** (causing a fork below the block containing Mallory’s transaction). When the blockchain fork resolves in favor of the new (longer) chain, the double-spent transaction replaces the original payment to Carol. Carol is now missing the three paintings and also has no bitcoin payment. Throughout all this activity, **Paul’s mining pool participants might remain blissfully unaware of the double-spend attempt, because they mine with automated miners and cannot monitor every transaction or block**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To protect against this kind of attack, a merchant **selling large-value items must wait at least six confirmations** before giving the product to the buyer. Alternatively, the merchant should use an escrow multisignature account, again waiting for several confirmations after the escrow account is funded. **The more confirmations elapse, the harder it becomes to invalidate a transaction with a 51% attack. For high-value items, payment by bitcoin will still be convenient and efficient even if the buyer has to wait 24 hours for delivery, which would correspond to approximately 144 confirmations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Denial of Service Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a double-spend attack, the other scenario for a consensus attack is to deny service to specific bitcoin participants (specific bitcoin addresses). **An attacker with a majority of the mining power can simply ignore specific transactions. If they are included in a block mined by another miner, the attacker can deliberately fork and remine that block, again excluding the specific transactions. This type of attack can result in a sustained denial-of-service against a specific address or set of addresses** for as long as the attacker controls the majority of the mining power.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical aspects of 51% attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Despite its name, the 51% attack scenario doesn’t actually require 51% of the hashing power. In fact, such an attack can be attempted with a smaller percentage of the hashing power. The 51% threshold is simply the level at which such an attack is almost guaranteed to succeed**. A consensus attack is essentially a tug-of-war for the next block and the \"stronger\" group is more likely to win. With less hashing power, the probability of success is reduced, because other miners control the generation of some blocks with their \"honest\" mining power. One way to look at it is that **the more hashing power an attacker has, the longer the fork he can deliberately create, the more blocks in the recent past he can invalidate, or the more blocks in the future he can control**. Security research groups have used statistical modeling to claim that **various types of consensus attacks are possible with as little as 30% of the hashing power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The massive increase of total hashing power has arguably made bitcoin impervious to attacks by a single miner. There is no possible way for a solo miner to control more than a small percentage of the total mining power. However, the centralization of control caused by mining pools has introduced the risk of **for-profit attacks** by a mining pool operator. **The pool operator in a managed pool controls the construction of candidate blocks and also controls which transactions are included. This gives the pool operator the power to exclude transactions or introduce double-spend transactions. If such abuse of power is done in a limited and subtle way, a pool operator could conceivably profit from a consensus attack without being noticed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all attackers will be motivated by profit, however. One potential attack scenario is where an attacker intends to disrupt the bitcoin network without the possibility of profiting from such disruption. A malicious attack aimed at crippling bitcoin would require enormous investment and covert planning, but could conceivably be launched by a well-funded, most likely state-sponsored, attacker. Alternatively, **a well-funded attacker could attack bitcoin’s consensus by simultaneously amassing mining hardware, compromising pool operators, and attacking other pools with denial-of-service. All of these scenarios are theoretically possible, but increasingly impractical as the bitcoin network’s overall hashing power continues to grow exponentially.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Undoubtedly, a serious consensus attack would erode confidence in bitcoin in the short term, possibly causing a significant price decline. **However, the bitcoin network and software are constantly evolving, so consensus attacks would be met with immediate countermeasures by the bitcoin community, making bitcoin more robust.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing the Consensus Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of consensus determine the validity of transactions and blocks. **These rules are the basis for collaboration between all bitcoin nodes and are responsible for the convergence of all local perspectives into a single consistent blockchain across the entire network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**While the consensus rules are invariable in the short term and must be consistent across all nodes, they are not invariable in the long term. In order to evolve and develop the bitcoin system, the rules have to change from time to time to accommodate new features, improvements, or bug fixes**. Unlike traditional software development, however, upgrades to a consensus system are much more difficult and require coordination between all the participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hard Forks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Blockchain Forks we looked at how the bitcoin network may briefly diverge, with two parts of the network following two different branches of the blockchain for a short time. We saw how this process occurs naturally, as part of the normal operation of the network and how the network reconverges on a common blockchain after one or more blocks are mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is another scenario in which the network may diverge into following two chains: a change in the consensus rules. This type of fork is called a hard fork, because after the fork the network does not reconverge onto a single chain. Instead, the two chains evolve independently. Hard forks occur when part of the network is operating under a different set of consensus rules than the rest of the network**. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Hard Forks may occur **because of a bug** or **because of a deliberate change in the implementation of the consensus rules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard forks can be used to change the rules of consensus, but they require coordination between all participants in the system. Any nodes that do not upgrade to the new consensus rules are unable to participate in the consensus mechanism and are forced onto a separate chain at the moment of the hard fork**. Thus, a change introduced by a hard fork can be thought of as not \"forward compatible,\" in that nonupgraded systems can no longer process the new consensus rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s examine the mechanics of a hard fork with a specific example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following shows a blockchain with two forks. At block height 4, a one-block fork occurs. This is the type of spontaneous fork we saw in Blockchain Forks. With the mining of block 5, the network reconverges on one chain and the fork is resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BlockchainForks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, however, at block height 6, a hard fork occurs. Let’s assume that a new implementation of the client is released with a change in the consensus rules. **Starting on block height 7, miners running this new implementation will accept a new type of digital signature, let’s call it a \"Smores\" signature, that is not ECDSA based. Immediately after, a node running the new implementation creates a transaction that contains a Smores signature and a miner with the updated software mines block `7b` containing this transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any node or miner that has not upgraded the software to validate Smores signatures is now unable to process block 7b. From their perspective, both the transaction that contained a Smores signature and block 7b that contained that transaction are invalid, because they are evaluating them based upon the old consensus rules**. These nodes will reject the transaction and the block and will not propagate them. Any miners that are using the old rules will not accept block 7b and will continue to mine a candidate block whose parent is block 6. In fact, miners using the old rules may not even receive block 7b if all the nodes they are connected to are also obeying the old rules and therefore not propagating the block. Eventually, they will be able to mine block 7a, which is valid under the old rules and does not contain any transactions with Smores signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The two chains continue to diverge from this point. Miners on the \"b\" chain will continue to accept and mine transactions containing Smores signatures, while miners on the \"a\" chain will continue to ignore these transactions**. Even if block 8b does not contain any Smores-signed transactions, the miners on the \"a\" chain cannot process it. To them it appears to be an orphan block, as its parent \"7b\" is not recognized as a valid block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hard Forks: Software, Network, Mining, and Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "For software developers, the term \"fork\" has another meaning, adding confusion to the term \"hard fork.\" **In open source software, a fork occurs when a group of developers choose to follow a different software roadmap and start a competing implementation of an open source project**. We’ve already discussed two circumstances that will lead to a hard fork: a bug in the consensus rules and a deliberate modification of the consensus rules. **In the case of a deliberate change to the consensus rules, a software fork precedes the hard fork. However, for this type of hard fork to occur, a new software implementation of the consensus rules must be developed, adopted, and launched.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of software forks that have attempted to change consensus rules include **Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic**, and most recently **Bitcoin Unlimited**. **However, none of these software forks have resulted in a hard fork. While a software fork is a necessary precondition, it is not in itself sufficient for a hard fork to occur. For a hard fork to occur, the competing implementation must be adopted and the new rules activated, by miners, wallets, and intermediary nodes.** Conversely, there are numerous alternative implementations of Bitcoin Core, and even software forks, that do not change the consensus rules and barring a bug, can coexist on the network and interoperate without causing a hard fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consensus rules may differ in obvious and explicit ways, in the validation of transactions or blocks. The rules may also differ in more subtle ways, in the implementation of the consensus rules as they apply to bitcoin scripts or cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures. Finally, the consensus rules may differ in unanticipated ways because of implicit consensus constraints imposed by system limitations or implementation details**. An example of the latter, unanticipated way, was seen in the unanticipated hard fork during the upgrade of Bitcoin Core 0.7 to 0.8, which was caused by a limitation in the Berkley DB implementation used to store blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, we can think of a **hard fork as developing in four stages: a software fork, a network fork, a mining fork, and a chain fork.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The process begins when an alternative implementation of the client, with modified consensus rules, is created by developers.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When this forked implementation is deployed in the network, a certain percentage of miners, wallet users, and intermediate nodes may adopt and run this implementation. **A resulting fork will depend upon whether the new consensus rules apply to blocks, transactions, or some other aspect of the system:**<br><br>\n",
    "    - If the new consensus rules pertain to transactions, then a wallet creating a transaction under the new rules may precipitate a network fork, followed by a hard fork when the transaction is mined into a block. <br><br>\n",
    "    - If the new rules pertain to blocks, then the hard fork process will begin when a block is mined under the new rules.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First, the network will fork**. Nodes based on the original implementation of the consensus rules will reject any transactions and blocks that are created under the new rules. **Furthermore, the nodes following the original consensus rules will temporarily ban and disconnect from any nodes that are sending them these invalid transactions and blocks. As a result, the network will partition into two: old nodes will only remain connected to old nodes and new nodes will only be connected to new nodes**. A single transaction or block based on the new rules will ripple through the network and result in the partition into two networks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Once a miner using the new rules mines a block, the mining power and chain will also fork. New miners will mine on top of the new block, while old miners will mine a separate chain based on the old rules. The partitioned network will make it so that the miners operating on separate consensus rules won’t likely receive each other’s blocks**, as they are connected to two separate networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diverging Miners and Difficulty\n",
    "\n",
    "As miners diverge into mining two different chains, the hashing power is split between the chains. The mining power can be split in any proportion between the two chains. The new rules may only be followed by a minority, or by the vast majority of the mining power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume, for example, an **80%–20% split, with the majority of the mining power using the new consensus rules**. Let’s also assume that the fork occurs immediately after a retargeting period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two chains would each inherit the difficulty from the retargeting period:\n",
    "- **The majority chain, mining under new consensus rules would have 80% of the previously available mining power committed to them. From the perspective of this chain, the mining power has suddenly declined by 20% vis-a-vis the previous period. Blocks will be found on average every 12.5 minutes, representing the 20% decline in mining power available to extend this chain. This rate of block issuance will continue (barring any changes in hashing power) until 2016 blocks are mined, which will take approximately 25,200 minutes (at 12.5 minutes per block), or 17.5 days. After 17.5 days, a retarget will occur and the difficulty will adjust (reduced by 20%) to produce 10-minute blocks again, based on the reduced amount of hashing power in this chain.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The minority chain, mining under the old rules with only 20% of the hashing power, will face a much more difficult task. On this chain, blocks will now be mined every 50 minutes on average. The difficulty will not be adjusted for 2016 blocks, which will take 100,800 minutes, or approximately 10 weeks to mine. Assuming a fixed capacity per block, this will also result in a reduction of transaction capacity by a factor of 5, as there are fewer blocks per hour available to record transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contentious Hard Forks\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the dawn of consensus software development. Just as open source development changed both the methods and products of software and created new methodologies, new tools, and new communities in its wake, consensus software development also represents a new frontier in computer science**. Out of the debates, experiments, and tribulations of the bitcoin development roadmap, we will see new development tools, practices, methodologies, and communities emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard forks are seen as risky because they force a minority to either upgrade or remain on a minority chain. **The risk of splitting the entire system into two competing systems is seen by many as an unacceptable risk**. As a result, many developers are reluctant to use the hard fork mechanism to implement upgrades to the consensus rules, unless there is near-unanimous support from the entire network. **Any hard fork proposals that do not have near-unanimous support are considered too \"contentious\" to attempt without risking a partition of the system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The issue of hard forks is highly controversial** in the bitcoin development community, especially as it relates to any proposed changes to the consensus rules controlling the maximum block size limit. \n",
    "- Some developers are opposed to any form of hard fork, seeing it as too risky. \n",
    "- Others see the mechanism of hard fork as an essential tool for upgrading the consensus rules in a way that avoids \"technical debt\" and provides a clean break with the past. \n",
    "- Finally, some developers see hard forks as a mechanism that should be used rarely, with a lot of advance planning and only under near-unanimous consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already we have seen the emergence of new methodologies to address the risks of hard forks. In the next section, we will look at soft forks, and the BIP-34 and BIP-9 methods for signaling and activation of consensus modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soft Forks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not all consensus rule changes cause a hard fork. Only consensus changes that are forward-incompatible cause a fork**. If the change is implemented in such a way that an unmodified client still sees the transaction or block as valid under the previous rules, the change can happen without a fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The term soft fork was introduced to distinguish this upgrade method from a \"hard fork.\"** In practice, a soft fork is not a fork at all. **A soft fork is a \"forward-compatible change\" to the consensus rules that allows unupgraded clients to continue to operate in consensus with the new rules.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect of soft forks that is not immediately obvious is that **soft fork upgrades can only be used to constrain the consensus rules, not to expand them.** In order to be forward compatible, transactions and blocks created under the new rules must be valid under the old rules too, but not vice versa. **The new rules can only limit what is valid; otherwise, they will trigger a hard fork when rejected under the old rules.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Soft forks can be implemented in a number of ways—the term does not specify a particular method, rather a set of methods that all have one thing in common: they don’t require all nodes to upgrade or force nonupgraded nodes out of consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Soft forks redefining NOP opcodes\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of soft forks have been implemented in bitcoin, based on the re-interpretation of NOP opcodes. **Bitcoin Script had ten opcodes reserved for future use, NOP1 through NOP10. Under the consensus rules, the presence of these opcodes in a script is interpreted as a null-potent operator, meaning they have no effect**. Execution continues after the NOP opcode as if it wasn’t there.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A soft fork therefore can modify the semantics of a NOP code to give it new meaning. For example, BIP-65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) reinterpreted the NOP2 opcode. Clients implementing BIP-65 interpret NOP2 as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and impose an absolute locktime consensus rule on UTXO that contain this opcode in their locking scripts. This change is a soft fork because a transaction that is valid under BIP-65 is also valid on any client that is not implementing (ignorant of) BIP-65.** To the old clients, the script contains an NOP code, which is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other ways to soft fork upgrade: Segwit\n",
    "\n",
    "The reinterpretation of NOP opcodes was both planned for and an obvious mechanism for consensus upgrades. Recently, however, another soft fork mechanism was introduced that does not rely on NOP opcodes for a very specific type of consensus change. This is examined in more detail in Segregated Witness. **Segwit is an architectural change to the structure of a transaction, which moves the unlocking script (witness) from inside the transaction to an external data structure (segregating it). Segwit was initially envisioned as a hard fork upgrade, as it modified a fundamental structure (transaction)**. In November 2015, a developer working on Bitcoin Core proposed a mechanism by which segwit could be introduced as a soft fork. **The mechanism used for this is a modification of the locking script of UTXO created under segwit rules, such that unmodified clients see the locking script as redeemable with any unlocking script whatsoever**. As a result, segwit can be introduced without requiring every node to upgrade or split from the chain: a soft fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that there are other, yet to be discovered, mechanisms by which upgrades can be made in a **forward-compatible way as a soft fork**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criticisms of Soft Forks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft forks based on the NOP opcodes are relatively uncontroversial.** The NOP opcodes were placed in Bitcoin Script with the explicit goal of allowing non-disruptive upgrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **many developers are concerned that other methods of soft fork upgrades make unacceptable tradeoffs. Common criticisms of soft fork changes include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical debt**<br>\n",
    "Because soft forks are more technically complex than a hard fork upgrade, **they introduce technical debt, a term that refers to increasing the future cost of code maintenance because of design tradeoffs made in the past**. Code complexity in turn increases the likelihood of bugs and security vulnerabilities.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation relaxation**<br>\n",
    "Unmodified clients see transactions as valid, without evaluating the modified consensus rules. **In effect, the unmodified clients are not validating using the full range of consensus rules, as they are blind to the new rules**. This applies to NOP-based upgrades, as well as other soft fork upgrades.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Irreversible upgrades**<br>\n",
    "**Because soft forks create transactions with additional consensus constraints, they become irreversible upgrades in practice. If a soft fork upgrade were to be reversed after beings activated, any transactions created under the new rules could result in a loss of funds under the old rules**. For example, if a CLTV transaction is evaluated under the old rules, there is no timelock constraint and it can be spent at any time. Therefore, critics contend that a failed soft fork that had to be reversed because of a bug would almost certainly lead to loss of funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soft Fork Signaling with Block Version\n",
    "\n",
    "Since soft forks allow unmodified clients to continue to operate within consensus, **the mechanism for \"activating\" a soft fork is through miners signaling readiness: a majority of miners must agree that they are ready and willing to enforce the new consensus rules**. To coordinate their actions, there is a signaling mechanism that allows them to show their support for a consensus rule change. This mechanism was introduced with the activation of BIP-34 in March 2013 and replaced by the activation of BIP-9 in July 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BIP-34 Signaling and Activation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first implementation, in BIP-34, used the block version field to allow miners to signal readiness for a specific consensus rule change**. Prior to BIP-34, the block version was set to \"1\" by convention not enforced by consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-34 defined a consensus rule change that required the coinbase field (input) of the coinbase transaction to contain the block height. Prior to BIP-34, the coinbase could contain any arbitrary data the miners chose to include**. After activation of BIP-34, valid blocks had to contain a specific block-height at the beginning of the coinbase and be identified with a version number greater than or equal to \"2.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**To signal the change and activation of BIP-34, miners set the block version to \"2,\" instead of \"1.\"** This did not immediately make version \"1\" blocks invalid. Once activated, version \"1\" blocks would become invalid and all version \"2\" blocks would be required to contain the block height in the coinbase to be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-34 defined a two-step activation mechanism, based on a rolling window of 1000 blocks. A miner would signal his or her individual readiness for BIP-34 by constructing blocks with \"2\" as the version number. **Strictly speaking, these blocks did not yet have to comply with the new consensus rule of including the block-height in the coinbase transaction because the consensus rule had not yet been activated. The consensus rules activated in two steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If 75% (750 of the most recent 1000 blocks) are marked with version \"2,\" then version \"2\" blocks must contain block height in the coinbase transaction or they are rejected as invalid**. Version \"1\" blocks are still accepted by the network and do not need to contain block-height. The old and new consensus rules coexist during this period.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When 95% (950 of the most recent 1000 blocks) are version \"2,\" version \"1\" blocks are no longer considered valid. Version \"2\" blocks are valid only if they contain the block-height in the coinbase** (as per the previous threshold). Thereafter, all blocks must comply with the new consensus rules, and all valid blocks must contain block-height in the coinbase transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After successful signaling and activation under the BIP-34 rules, **this mechanism was used twice more to activate soft forks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BIP-66 Strict DER Encoding of Signatures was activated by BIP-34 style signaling with a block version \"3\" and invalidating version \"2\" blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BIP-65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY was activated by BIP-34 style signaling with a block version \"4\" and invalidating version \"3\" blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the activation of BIP-65, the signaling and activation mechanism of BIP-34 was retired and replaced with the BIP-9 signaling mechanism described next.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BIP-9 Signaling and Activation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The mechanism used by BIP-34, BIP-66, and BIP-65 was successful in activating three soft forks. However, it was replaced because it had several limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using the integer value of the block version, only one soft fork could be activated at a time, so it required coordination between soft fork proposals and agreement on their prioritization and sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Furthermore, because the block version was incremented, the mechanism didn’t offer a straightforward way to reject a change and then propose a different one. If old clients were still running, they could mistake signaling for a new change as signaling for the previously rejected change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each new change irrevocably reduced the available block versions for future changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-9 was proposed to overcome these challenges and improve the rate and ease of implementing future changes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-9 interprets the block version as a bit field instead of an integer**. Because the block version was originally used as an integer, versions 1 through 4, only 29 bits remain available to be used as a bit field. **This leaves 29 bits that can be used to independently and simultaneously signal readiness on 29 different proposals.**\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-9 also sets a **maximum time for signaling and activation**. This way miners don’t need to signal forever. **If a proposal is not activated within the TIMEOUT period (defined in the proposal), the proposal is considered rejected**. The proposal may be resubmitted for signaling with a different bit, renewing the activation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Furthermore, after the TIMEOUT has passed and a feature has been activated or rejected, the signaling bit can be reused for another feature without confusion. Therefore, up to 29 changes can be signaled in parallel and after TIMEOUT the bits can be \"recycled\" to propose new changes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> While signaling bits can be reused or recycled, as long as the voting period does not overlap, the authors of BIP-9 recommend that bits are reused only when necessary; unexpected behavior could occur due to bugs in older software. In short, we should not expect to see reuse until all 29 bits have been used once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed changes are identified by a data structure that contains the following fields:\n",

    "## Consensus Software Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Consensus software continues to evolve and there is much discussion on the various mechanisms for changing the consensus rules. By its very nature, bitcoin sets a very high bar on coordination and consensus for changes. As a decentralized system, it has no \"authority\" that can impose its will on the participants of the network. Power is diffused between multiple constituencies such as miners, core developers, wallet developers, exchanges, merchants, and end users. **Decisions cannot be made unilaterally by any of these constituencies. For example, while miners can theoretically change the rules by simple majority (51%), they are constrained by the consent of the other constituencies. If they act unilaterally, the rest of the participants may simply refuse to follow them, keeping the economic activity on a minority chain. Without economic activity (transactions, merchants, wallets, exchanges), the miners will be mining a worthless coin with empty blocks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**This diffusion of power means that all the participants must coordinate, or no changes can be made. Status quo is the stable state of this system with only a few changes possible if there is strong consensus by a very large majority. The 95% threshold for soft forks is reflective of this reality.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important to recognize that there is no perfect solution for consensus development. Both hard forks and soft forks involve tradeoffs.** For some types of changes, soft forks may be a better choice; for others, hard forks may be a better choice. There is no perfect choice; both carry risks. The one constant characteristic of consensus software development is that change is difficult and consensus forces compromise.\n",

You can lose it, misplace it, have it stolen, or accidentally give the wrong amount to someone. In every one of these cases, users have no recourse, just as if they dropped cash on a public sidewalk.**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **bitcoin has capabilities that cash, gold, and bank accounts do not. A bitcoin wallet, containing your keys, can be backed up like any file**. It can be stored in multiple copies, even printed on paper for hard-copy backup. You can’t \"back up\" cash, gold, or bank accounts. Bitcoin is different enough from anything that has come before that we need to think about bitcoin security in a novel way too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The core principle in bitcoin is decentralization and it has important implications for security. A centralized model, such as a traditional bank or payment network, depends on access control and vetting to keep bad actors out of the system. By comparison, **a decentralized system like bitcoin pushes the responsibility and control to the users. Because security of the network is based on Proof-of-Work, not access control, the network can be open and no encryption is required for bitcoin traffic.**\n",
    "\n",
    "On a traditional payment network, such as a credit card system, the payment is open-ended because it contains the user’s private identifier (the credit card number). After the initial charge, anyone with access to the identifier can \"pull\" funds and charge the owner again and again. Thus, **a traditional payment network has to be secured end-to-end with encryption and must ensure that no eavesdroppers or intermediaries can compromise the payment traffic, in transit or when it is stored (at rest).** If a bad actor gains access to the system, he can compromise current transactions and payment tokens that can be used to create new transactions. Worse, when customer data is compromised, the customers are exposed to identity theft and must take action to prevent fraudulent use of the compromised accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin is dramatically different. A bitcoin transaction authorizes only a specific value to a specific recipient and cannot be forged or modified.** It does not reveal any private information, such as the identities of the parties, and cannot be used to authorize additional payments. Therefore, a bitcoin payment network does not need to be encrypted or protected from eavesdropping. **In fact, you can broadcast bitcoin transactions over an open public channel, such as unsecured WiFi or Bluetooth, with no loss of security.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin’s decentralized security model puts a lot of power in the hands of the users. With that power comes responsibility for maintaining the secrecy of the keys**. For most users that is not easy to do, especially on general-purpose computing devices such as internet-connected smartphones or laptops. Although bitcoin’s decentralized model prevents the type of mass compromise seen with credit cards, **many users are not able to adequately secure their keys and get hacked, one by one.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing Bitcoin Systems Securely\n",
    "\n",
    ">The most important principle for bitcoin developers is decentralization. **Most developers will be familiar with centralized security models and might be tempted to apply these models to their bitcoin applications, with disastrous results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin’s security relies on decentralized control over keys and on independent transaction validation by miners**. If you want to leverage bitcoin’s security, you need to ensure that you remain within the bitcoin security model. In simple terms:\n",
    "- Don’t take control of keys away from users \n",
    "- Don’t take transactions off the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: many early bitcoin exchanges concentrated all user funds in a single **\"hot\" wallet** with keys stored on a single server. **Such a design removes control from users and centralizes control over keys in a single system. Many such systems have been hacked, with disastrous consequences for their customers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common mistake is to take **transactions \"off blockchain\"** in a misguided effort to reduce transaction fees or accelerate transaction processing. **An \"off blockchain\" system will record transactions on an internal, centralized ledger and only occasionally synchronize them to the bitcoin blockchain. This practice, again, substitutes decentralized bitcoin security with a proprietary and centralized approach**. When transactions are off blockchain, improperly secured centralized ledgers can be falsified, diverting funds and depleting reserves, unnoticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are prepared to invest heavily in operational security, multiple layers of access control, and audits (as the traditional banks do) you should think very carefully before taking funds outside of bitcoin’s decentralized security context. Even if you have the funds and discipline to implement a robust security model, such a design merely replicates the fragile model of traditional financial networks, plagued by identity theft, corruption, and embezzlement. **To take advantage of bitcoin’s unique decentralized security model, you have to avoid the temptation of centralized architectures that might feel familiar but ultimately subvert bitcoin’s security.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Root of Trust\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional security architecture is based upon a concept called the root of trust**, which is a trusted core used as the foundation for the security of the overall system or application. **Security architecture is developed around the root of trust as a series of concentric circles, like layers in an onion, extending trust outward from the center. Each layer builds upon the more-trusted inner layer using access controls, digital signatures, encryption, and other security primitives**. As software systems become more complex, they are more likely to contain bugs, which make them vulnerable to security compromise. As a result, the more complex a software system becomes, the harder it is to secure. **The root of trust concept ensures that most of the trust is placed within the least complex part of the system, and therefore least vulnerable, parts of the system, while more complex software is layered around it.** This security architecture is repeated at different scales, first establishing a root of trust within the hardware of a single system, then extending that root of trust through the operating system to higher-level system services, and finally across many servers layered in concentric circles of diminishing trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin security architecture is different. **In bitcoin, the consensus system creates a trusted public ledger that is completely decentralized. A correctly validated blockchain uses the genesis block as the root of trust, building a chain of trust up to the current block. Bitcoin systems can and should use the blockchain as their root of trust.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a complex bitcoin application that consists of services on many different systems, you should carefully examine the security architecture in order to ascertain where trust is being placed. **Ultimately, the only thing that should be explicitly trusted is a fully validated blockchain. If your application explicitly or implicitly vests trust in anything but the blockchain, that should be a source of concern because it introduces vulnerability. **\n",
    "\n",
    "A good method to evaluate the security architecture of your application is to consider each individual component and evaluate a hypothetical scenario where that component is completely compromised and under the control of a malicious actor. **Take each component of your application, in turn, and assess the impacts on the overall security if that component is compromised. If your application is no longer secure when components are compromised, that shows you have misplaced trust in those components.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> A bitcoin application without vulnerabilities should be vulnerable only to a compromise of the bitcoin consensus mechanism, meaning that its root of trust is based on the strongest part of the bitcoin security architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerous examples of hacked bitcoin exchanges serve to underscore this point because their security architecture and design fails even under the most casual scrutiny. **These centralized implementations had invested trust explicitly in numerous components outside the bitcoin blockchain, such as hot wallets, centralized ledger databases, vulnerable encryption keys, and similar schemes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Security Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have used physical security controls for thousands of years. By comparison, our experience with digital security is less than 50 years old. **Modern general-purpose operating systems are not very secure and not particularly suited to storing digital money. Our computers are constantly exposed to external threats via always-on internet connections**. They run thousands of software components from hundreds of authors, often with unconstrained access to the user’s files. **A single piece of rogue software, among the many thousands installed on your computer, can compromise your keyboard and files, stealing any bitcoin stored in wallet applications**. The level of computer maintenance required to keep a computer virus-free and trojan-free is beyond the skill level of all but a tiny minority of computer users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite decades of research and advancements in information security, digital assets are still woefully vulnerable to a determined adversary. Even the most highly protected and restricted systems, in financial services companies, intelligence agencies, and defense contractors, are frequently breached. **Bitcoin creates digital assets that have intrinsic value and can be stolen and diverted to new owners instantly and irrevocably. This creates a massive incentive for hackers**. Until now, hackers had to convert identity information or account tokens—such as credit cards and bank accounts—into value after compromising them. Despite the difficulty of fencing and laundering financial information, we have seen ever-escalating thefts. **Bitcoin escalates this problem because it doesn’t need to be fenced or laundered; it is intrinsic value within a digital asset.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, bitcoin also creates the incentives to improve computer security. Whereas previously the risk of computer compromise was vague and indirect, bitcoin makes these risks clear and obvious. **Holding bitcoin on a computer serves to focus the user’s mind on the need for improved computer security. As a direct result of the proliferation and increased adoption of bitcoin and other digital currencies, we have seen an escalation in both hacking techniques and security solutions. In simple terms, hackers now have a very juicy target and users have a clear incentive to defend themselves.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past three years, as a direct result of bitcoin adoption, we have seen tremendous innovation in the realm of information security in the form of hardware encryption, key storage and hardware wallets, multisignature technology, and digital escrow. In the following sections we will examine various best practices for practical user security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical Bitcoin Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because most users are far more comfortable with physical security than information security, a very effective method for protecting bitcoin is to convert them into physical form**. Bitcoin keys are nothing more than long numbers. This means that they can be stored in a physical form, such as printed on paper or etched on a metal coin. Securing the keys then becomes as simple as physically securing the printed copy of the bitcoin keys. **A set of bitcoin keys that is printed on paper is called a \"paper wallet,\" and there are many free tools that can be used to create them**. I personally keep the vast majority of my bitcoin (99% or more) stored on paper wallets, encrypted with BIP-38, with multiple copies locked in safes. **Keeping bitcoin offline is called cold storage and it is one of the most effective security techniques.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> A cold storage system is one where the keys are generated on an offline system (one never connected to the internet) and stored offline either on paper or on digital media, such as a USB memory stick.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the long term, bitcoin security increasingly will take the form of hardware tamper-proof wallets. Unlike a smartphone or desktop computer, a bitcoin hardware wallet has just one purpose: to hold bitcoin securely. **Without general-purpose software to compromise and with limited interfaces, hardware wallets can deliver an almost foolproof level of security to nonexpert users.** I expect to see hardware wallets become the predominant method of bitcoin storage. For an example of such a hardware wallet, see the Trezor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Balancing Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Although most users are rightly concerned about bitcoin theft, there is an even bigger risk. Data files get lost all the time. If they contain bitcoin, the loss is much more painful. In the effort to secure their bitcoin wallets, users must be very careful not to go too far and end up losing the bitcoin. **In July 2011, a well-known bitcoin awareness and education project lost almost 7,000 bitcoin. In their effort to prevent theft, the owners had implemented a complex series of encrypted backups. In the end they accidentally lost the encryption keys, making the backups worthless and losing a fortune**. Like hiding money by burying it in the desert, if you secure your bitcoin too well you might not be able to find it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diversifying Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you carry your entire net worth in cash in your wallet? Most people would consider that reckless, yet bitcoin users often keep all their bitcoin in a single wallet. Instead, **users should spread the risk among multiple and diverse bitcoin wallets. Prudent users will keep only a small fraction, perhaps less than 5%, of their bitcoin in an online or mobile wallet as \"pocket change.\" The rest should be split between a few different storage mechanisms**, such as a desktop wallet and offline (cold storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multisig and Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Whenever a company or individual stores large amounts of bitcoin, they should consider using a multisignature bitcoin address. Multisignature addresses secure funds by requiring more than one signature to make a payment. The signing keys should be stored in a number of different locations and under the control of different people.** In a corporate environment, for example, the keys should be generated independently and held by several company executives, to ensure no single person can compromise the funds. Multisignature addresses can also offer redundancy, where a single person holds several keys that are stored in different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Survivability\n",
    "\n",
    "One important security consideration that is often overlooked is availability, especially in the context of incapacity or death of the key holder. **Bitcoin users are told to use complex passwords and keep their keys secure and private, not sharing them with anyone. Unfortunately, that practice makes it almost impossible for the user’s family to recover any funds if the user is not available to unlock them**. In most cases, in fact, the families of bitcoin users might be completely unaware of the existence of the bitcoin funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **If you have a lot of bitcoin, you should consider sharing access details with a trusted relative or lawyer**. A more complex survivability scheme can be set up with multi-signature access and estate planning through a lawyer specialized as a \"digital asset executor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a completely new, unprecedented, and complex technology. Over time we will develop better security tools and practices that are easier to use by nonexperts. **For now, bitcoin users can use many of the tips discussed here to enjoy a secure and trouble-free bitcoin experience.**\n",

    "# Blockchain Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now build on our understanding of bitcoin by looking at it as an application platform. **Nowadays, many people use the term \"blockchain\" to refer to any application platform that shares the design principles of bitcoin. The term is often misused and applied to many things that fail to deliver the primary features that bitcoin’s blockchain delivers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section **we will look at the features offered by the bitcoin blockchain, as an application platform**. We will consider the application building primitives, which form the building blocks of any blockchain application. We will look at several important applications that use these primitives, such as colored coins, payment (state) channels, and routed payment channels (Lightning Network).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin system was designed as a decentralized currency and payment system. However, most of its functionality is derived from much lower-level constructs that can be used for much broader applications. Bitcoin wasn’t built with components such as accounts, users, balances, and payments. **Instead, it uses a transactional scripting language with low-level cryptographic functions. Just as the higher-level concepts of accounts, balances, and payments can be derived from these basic primitives, so can many other complex applications. Thus, the bitcoin blockchain can become an application platform offering trust services to applications, such as smart contracts, far surpassing the original purpose of digital currency and payments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Blocks (Primitives)\n",
    "\n",
    "When operating correctly and over the long term, the bitcoin system offers certain guarantees, which can be used as building blocks to create applications. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Double-Spend**<br>\n",
    "The most fundamental guarantee of bitcoin’s decentralized consensus algorithm ensures that no UTXO can be spent twice.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutability**<br>\n",
    "Once a transaction is recorded in the blockchain and sufficient work has been added with subsequent blocks, the transaction’s data becomes immutable. Immutability is underwritten by energy, as rewriting the blockchain requires the expenditure of energy to produce Proof-of-Work. The energy required and therefore the degree of immutability increases with the amount of work committed on top of the block containing a transaction.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neutrality**<br>\n",
    "The decentralized bitcoin network propagates valid transactions regardless of the origin or content of those transactions. This means that anyone can create a valid transaction with sufficient fees and trust they will be able to transmit that transaction and have it included in the blockchain at any time.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure Timestamping**<br>\n",
    "The consensus rules reject any block whose timestamp is too far in the past or future. This ensures that timestamps on blocks can be trusted. The timestamp on a block implies an unspent-before guarantee for the inputs of all included transactions.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Authorization**<br>\n",
    "Digital signatures, validated in a decentralized network, offer authorization guarantees. Scripts that contain a requirement for a digital signature cannot be executed without authorization by the holder of the private key implied in the script.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auditability**<br>\n",
    "All transactions are public and can be audited. All transactions and blocks can be linked back in an unbroken chain to the genesis block.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accounting**<br>\n",
    "In any transaction (except the coinbase transaction) the value of inputs is equal to the value of outputs plus fees. It is not possible to create or destroy bitcoin value in a transaction. The outputs cannot exceed the inputs.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonexpiration**<br>\n",
    "A valid transaction does not expire. If it is valid today, it will be valid in the near future, as long as the inputs remain unspent and the consensus rules do not change.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrity**<br>\n",
    "A bitcoin transaction signed with SIGHASH_ALL or parts of a transaction signed by another SIGHASH type cannot be modified without invalidating the signature, thus invalidating the transaction itself.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transaction Atomicity**<br>\n",
    "Bitcoin transactions are atomic. They are either valid and confirmed (mined) or not. Partial transactions cannot be mined and there is no interim state for a transaction. At any point in time a transaction is either mined, or not.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete (Indivisible) Units of Value**<br>\n",
    "Transaction outputs are discrete and indivisible units of value. They can either be spent or unspent, in full. They cannot be divided or partially spent.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quorum of Control**<br>\n",
    "Multisignature constraints in scripts impose a quorum of authorization, predefined in the multisignature scheme. The M-of-N requirement is enforced by the consensus rules.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timelock/Aging**<br>\n",
    "Any script clause containing a relative or absolute timelock can only be executed after its age exceeds the time specified.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication**<br>\n",
    "The decentralized storage of the blockchain ensures that when a transaction is mined, after sufficient confirmations, it is replicated across the network and becomes durable and resilient to power loss, data loss, etc.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forgery Protection**<br>\n",
    "A transaction can only spend existing, validated outputs. It is not possible to create or counterfeit value.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**<br>\n",
    "In the absence of miner partitions, blocks that are recorded in the blockchain are subject to reorganization or disagreement with exponentially decreasing likelihood, based on the depth at which they are recorded. Once deeply recorded, the computation and energy required to change makes change practically infeasible.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recording External State**<br>\n",
    "A transaction can commit a data value, via OP_RETURN, representing a state transition in an external state machine.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predictable Issuance**<br>\n",
    "Less than 21 million bitcoin will be issued, at a predictable rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of building blocks is not complete and more are added with each new feature introduced into bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications from Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**The building blocks offered by bitcoin are elements of a trust platform that can be used to compose applications**. Here are some examples of applications that exist today and the building blocks they use:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof-of-Existence (Digital Notary)**<br>\n",
    "`Immutability + Timestamp + Durability`. A digital fingerprint can be committed with a transaction to the blockchain, proving that a document existed (Timestamp) at the time it was recorded. The fingerprint cannot be modified ex-post-facto (Immutability) and the proof will be stored permanently (Durability).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kickstarter (Lighthouse)**<br>\n",
    "`Consistency + Atomicity + Integrity`. If you sign one input and the output (Integrity) of a fundraiser transaction, others can contribute to the fundraiser but it cannot be spent (Atomicity) until the goal (output value) is funded (Consistency).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Payment Channels**<br>\n",
    "`Quorum of Control + Timelock + No Double Spend + Nonexpiration + Censorship Resistance + Authorization`. A multisig 2-of-2 (Quorum) with a timelock (Timelock) used as the \"settlement\" transaction of a payment channel can be held (Nonexpiration) and spent at any time (Censorship Resistance) by either party (Authorization). The two parties can then create commitment transactions that double-spend (No Double-Spend) the settlement on a shorter timelock (Timelock).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Colored Coins\n",
    "\n",
    "The first blockchain application we will discuss is colored coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colored coins refers to a set of similar technologies that use bitcoin transactions to record the creation, ownership, and transfer of extrinsic assets other than bitcoin. By \"extrinsic\" we mean assets that are not stored directly on the bitcoin blockchain**, as opposed to bitcoin itself, which is an asset intrinsic to the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colored coins are used to track digital assets as well as physical assets held by third parties and traded through colored coins certificates of ownership**.\n",
    "- **Digital asset colored coins** can represent intangible assets such as a stock certificate, license, virtual property (game items), or most any form of licensed intellectual property (trademarks, copyrights, etc.). \n",
    "- **Tangible asset colored coins** can represent certificates of ownership of commodities (gold, silver, oil), land title, automobiles, boats, aircraft, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The term derives from the idea of \"coloring\" or marking a nominal amount of bitcoin, for example, a single satoshi, to represent something other than the bitcoin value itself. As an analogy, consider stamping a $ \\$ $1 note with a message saying, \"this is a stock certificate of ACME\" or \"this note can be redeemed for 1 oz of silver\" and then trading the $ \\$ $1 note as a certificate of ownership of this other asset. The first implementation of colored coins, named Enhanced Padded-Order-Based Coloring or EPOBC, assigned extrinsic assets to a 1-satoshi output**. In this way, it was a true \"colored coin,\" as each asset was added as an attribute (color) of a single satoshi.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**More recent implementations of colored coins use the OP_RETURN script opcode to store metadata in a transaction**, in conjunction with external data stores that associate the metadata to specific assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most prominent implementations of colored coins today are [Open Assets](http://www.openassets.org/) and [Colored Coins by Colu](http://coloredcoins.org/). These two systems use different approaches to colored coins and are not compatible. Colored coins created in one system cannot be seen or used in the other system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Colored Coins\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colored coins are created, transferred, and generally viewed in special wallets that can interpret the colored coins protocol metadata attached to bitcoin transactions. Special care must be taken to avoid using a colored-coin–related key in a regular bitcoin wallet, as the regular wallet may destroy the metadata. Similarly, colored coins should not be sent to addresses managed by regular wallets, but only to addresses that are managed by wallets that are colored-coin-aware**. Both Colu and Open Assets systems use special colored-coin addresses to mitigate this risk and to ensure that colored coins are not sent to unaware wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colored coins are also not visible to most general-purpose blockchain explorers. Instead, you **must use a colored-coins explorer to interpret the metadata of a colored coins transaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Open Assets-compatible wallet application and blockchain explorer can be found at [coinprism](https://www.coinprism.info/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Colu Colored Coins-compatible wallet application and blockchain explorer can be found at [Blockchain Explorer](http://coloredcoins.org/explorer/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Copay wallet plug-in can be found at [Colored Coins Copay Addon](http://coloredcoins.org/colored-coins-copay-addon/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issuing Colored Coins\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the colored coins implementations has a different way of creating colored coins, but they all provide similar functionality. **The process of creating a colored coin asset is called \"issuance\". An initial transaction, the issuance transaction registers the asset on the bitcoin blockchain and creates an \"asset ID\" that is used to reference the asset. Once issued, assets can be transferred between addresses using \"transfer transactions\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assets issued as colored coins can have multiple properties**: \n",
    "- They can be **divisible or indivisible**, meaning that the amount of asset in a transfer can be an integer (e.g., 5) or have decimal subdivision (e.g., 4.321). \n",
    "- Assets can also have **fixed issuance**, meaning a certain amount are issued only once, **or can be reissued**, meaning that new units of the asset can be issued by the original issuer after the initial issuance.\n",
    "- Finally, some colored coins enable **dividends**, allowing the distribution of bitcoin payments to the owners of a colored coin asset in proportion to their ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colored Coins Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"metadata\" that gives meaning to a colored coin transaction is usually stored in one of the outputs using the OP_RETURN opcode**. Different colored coins protocols use different encodings for the content of the OP_RETURN data. The output containing the OP_RETURN is called the **marker output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The order of the outputs and position of the marker output may have special meaning in the colored coins protocol.** In Open Assets, for example, any outputs before the marker output represent asset issuance. Any outputs after the marker represent asset transfer. **The marker output assigns specific values and colors to the other outputs by referencing their order in the transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Colored Coins (Colu), by comparison, the marker output encodes an opcode that determines how the metadata is interpreted.** Opcodes `0x01` through `0x0F` indicate an issuance transaction. An issuance opcode is usually followed by an asset ID or other identifier that can be used to retrieve the asset information from an external source (e.g., bittorrent). Opcodes `0x10` through `0x1F` represent a transfer transaction. Transfer transaction metadata contain simple scripts that transfer specific amounts of assets from inputs to outputs, by reference to their index. Ordering of inputs and outputs is therefore important in the interpretation of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the metadata is too long to fit in OP_RETURN, the colored coins protocol may use other \"tricks\" to store metadata in a transaction**. Examples include putting metadata in a redeem script, followed by OP_DROP opcodes to ensure the script ignores the metadata. Another mechanism used is a 1-of-N multisig script where only the first public key is a real public key that can spend the output and subsequent \"keys\" are replaced by encoded metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In order to correctly interpret the metadata in a colored coins transaction you must use a compatible wallet or block explorer. Otherwise, the transaction looks like a \"normal\" bitcoin transaction with an OP_RETURN output.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, I created and issued a MasterBTC asset using colored coins. The MasterBTC asset represents a voucher for a free copy of this book. These vouchers can be transferred, traded, and redeemed using a colored coins-compatible wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular example, I used the wallet and explorer at https://coinprism.info, which uses the Open Assets colored coins protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following shows the issuance transaction using the Coinprism block explorer:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/IssuanceTransac.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, coinprism shows the issuance of 20 units of \"Free copy of Mastering Bitcoin,\" the MasterBTC asset, to a special colored coin address: `akTnsDt5uzpioRST76VFRQM8q8sBFnQiwcx`\n",
    "\n",
    "The transaction ID of the issuance transaction is a \"normal\" bitcoin transaction ID. Following shows that same transaction in a block explorer that doesn’t decode colored coins. We’ll use blockchain.info: https://blockchain.info/tx/10d7c4e022f35288779be6713471151ede967caaa39eecd35296aa36d9c109ec\n",

    "\n",
    "Counterparty is a protocol layer built on top of bitcoin. **The Counterparty protocol, similar to colored coins, offers the ability to create and trade virtual assets and tokens. In addition, Counterparty offers a decentralized exchange for assets. Counterparty is also implementing smart contracts, based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the colored coins protocols, **Counterparty embeds metadata in bitcoin transactions, using the OP_RETURN opcode or 1-of-N multisignature addresses that encode metadata in the place of public keys**. Using these mechanisms, Counterparty implements a protocol layer encoded in bitcoin transactions. **The additional protocol layer can be interpreted by applications that are Counterparty-aware, such as wallets and blockchain explorers, or any application built using the Counterparty libraries.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counterparty can be used as a platform for other applications and services, in turn**. For example, **Tokenly is a platform built on top of Counterparty** that allows content creators, artists, and companies to issue tokens that express digital ownership and can be used to rent, access, trade, or shop for content, products, and services. **Other applications leveraging Counterparty include games (Spells of Genesis) and grid computing projects (Folding Coin).**\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about Counterparty can be found at https://counterparty.io. The open source project can be found at https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP."
