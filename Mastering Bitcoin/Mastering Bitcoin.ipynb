    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Bitcoin?\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Bitcoin, apart from being the name of a cryptocurrency, is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem**. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. The bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin are entirely virtual. There are no physical coins or even digital coins per se. The coins are implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient. **Users of bitcoin own keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin network. With these keys they can sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner**. Keys are often stored in a digital wallet on each user’s computer or smartphone. **Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin**, putting the control entirely in the hands of each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can it be used for?<br>\n",
    "Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, including buy and sell goods, send money to people or organizations, or extend credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Bitcoins are created? [Overview]\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a distributed, peer-to-peer system. As such there is no \"central\" server or point of control.<br> **Bitcoin are created through a process called mining, which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions. Any participant in the bitcoin network (i.e., anyone using a device running the full bitcoin protocol stack) may operate as a miner, using their computer’s processing power to verify and record transactions**.<br> Every 10 minutes, on average, a bitcoin miner is able to validate the transactions of the past 10 minutes and is rewarded with brand new bitcoin. Essentially, bitcoin mining decentralizes the currency-issuance and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces the need for any central bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin protocol includes built-in algorithms that regulate the mining function across the network. The difficulty of the processing task that miners must perform is adjusted dynamically so that, on average, someone succeeds every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners (and how much processing) are competing at any moment. **The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoin are created every 4 years, and limits the total number of bitcoin that will be created to a fixed total just below 21 million coins.** The result is that the number of bitcoin in circulation closely follows an easily predictable curve that approaches 21 million by the year 2140. Due to bitcoin’s diminishing rate of issuance, over the long term, the bitcoin currency is deflationary. Furthermore, bitcoin cannot be inflated by \"printing\" new money above and beyond the expected issuance rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, bitcoin is also the name of the protocol, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed computing innovation. The bitcoin currency is really only the first application of this invention. Bitcoin represents the culmination of decades of research in cryptography and distributed systems and includes four key innovations brought together in a unique and powerful combination. Bitcoin consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bitcoin Protocol**: A decentralized peer-to-peer network <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blockchain**: A public transaction ledger <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consensus Rules**: A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proof-of-Work Algorithm**: A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is akin to the internet of money, a network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Currencies Before Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence of viable digital money is closely linked to developments in cryptography. This is not surprising when one considers the fundamental challenges involved with using bits to represent value that can be exchanged for goods and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three basic questions for anyone accepting digital money are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I trust that the money is authentic and not counterfeit?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I trust that the digital money can only be spent once (known as the “double-spend” problem)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I be sure that no one else can claim this money belongs to them and not me?**\n",
    "\n",
    "How Paper Money addresses these issues:<br>\n",
    "Issuers of paper money are constantly battling the counterfeiting problem by using increasingly sophisticated papers and printing technology. Physical money addresses the double-spend issue easily because the same paper note cannot be in two places at once. Of course, conventional money is also often stored and transmitted digitally. In these cases, the counterfeiting and double-spend issues are handled by clearing all electronic transactions through central authorities that have a global view of the currency in circulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "How Digital Money address them:<br>\n",
    "For digital money, which cannot take advantage of esoteric inks or holographic strips, **cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user’s claim to value. Specifically, cryptographic digital signatures enable a user to sign a digital asset or transaction proving the ownership of that asset**. With the appropriate architecture, digital signatures also can be used to address the double-spend issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The History of Digital Currencies\n",
    "\n",
    "When cryptography started becoming more broadly available and understood in the late 1980s, many researchers began trying to use cryptography to build digital currencies. These early digital currency projects issued digital money, usually backed by a national currency or precious metal such as gold. Although these earlier digital currencies worked, **they were centralized** and, as a result, were easy to attack by governments and hackers. **Early digital currencies used a central clearinghouse to settle all transactions at regular intervals, just like a traditional banking system**. Unfortunately, in most cases these nascent digital currencies were targeted by worried governments and eventually litigated out of existence. Some failed in spectacular crashes when the parent company liquidated abruptly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be robust against intervention by antagonists, whether legitimate governments or criminal elements, a decentralized digital currency was needed to avoid a single point of attack. **Bitcoin is such a system, decentralized by design, and free of any central authority or point of control that can be attacked or corrupted.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin was invented in 2008 with the publication of a paper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" written under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto (see [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)). Nakamoto combined several prior inventions such as b-money and HashCash to create a completely decentralized electronic cash system that does not rely on a central authority for currency issuance or settlement and validation of transactions.<br> **The key innovation was to use a distributed computation system (called a \"Proof-of-Work\" algorithm) to conduct a global \"election\" every 10 minutes, allowing the decentralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions. This elegantly solves the issue of double-spend where a single currency unit can be spent twice.** Previously, the double-spend problem was a weakness of digital currency and was addressed by clearing all transactions through a central clearinghouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin network started in 2009, based on a reference implementation published by Nakamoto and since revised by many other programmers. **The implementation of the Proof-of-Work algorithm (mining) that provides security and resilience for bitcoin has increased in power exponentially, and now exceeds the combined processing power of the world’s top supercomputers**. Bitcoin’s total market value has at times exceeded 135 billion US dollars, depending on the bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate. The largest transaction processed so far by the network was 400 million US dollars, transmitted instantly and processed for a fee of 1 US dollar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from the public in April 2011, leaving the responsibility of developing the code and network to a thriving group of volunteers. The identity of the person or people behind bitcoin is still unknown. However, neither Satoshi Nakamoto nor anyone else exerts individual control over the bitcoin system, which operates based on fully transparent mathematical principles, open source code, and consensus among participants. The invention itself is groundbreaking and has already spawned new science in the fields of distributed computing, economics, and econometrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Solution to a Distributed Computing Problem (Byzantine Generals' Problem)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention is also a practical and novel solution to a problem in distributed computing, known as the \"Byzantine Generals' Problem.\" Briefly, the problem consists of trying to agree on a course of action or the state of a system by exchanging information over an unreliable and potentially compromised network. **Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution, which uses the concept of Proof-of-Work to achieve consensus without a central trusted authority, represents a breakthrough in distributed computing and has wide applicability beyond currency**. It can be used to achieve consensus on decentralized networks to prove the fairness of elections, lotteries, asset registries, digital notarization, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is an innovation in the ancient technology of money. At its core, money simply facilitates the exchange of value between people. Therefore, in order to fully understand bitcoin and its uses, we’ll examine it from the perspective of people using it. Each of the people and their stories, as listed here, illustrates one or more specific use cases. We’ll be seeing them throughout the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **North American low-value retail**<br>\n",
    "Alice lives in Northern California’s Bay Area. She has heard about bitcoin from her techie friends and wants to start using it. We will follow her story as she learns about bitcoin, acquires some, and then spends some of her bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee at Bob’s Cafe in Palo Alto. This story will introduce us to the software, the exchanges, and basic transactions from the perspective of a retail consumer.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **North American high-value retail**<br>\n",

    "Jing is a computer engineering student in Shanghai. He has built a \"mining\" rig to mine for bitcoin using his engineering skills to supplement his income. This story will examine the \"industrial\" base of bitcoin: the specialized equipment used to secure the bitcoin network and issue new currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these stories is based on the real people and real industries currently using bitcoin to create new markets, new industries, and innovative solutions to global economic issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin is a protocol that can be accessed using a client application that speaks the protocol**. A **\"bitcoin wallet\"** is the most common user interface to the bitcoin system, just like a web browser is the most common user interface for the HTTP protocol. There are many implementations and brands of bitcoin wallets, just like there are many brands of web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer). And just like we all have our favorite browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Yay!) and our villains (Internet Explorer, Yuck!), bitcoin wallets vary in quality, performance, security, privacy, and reliability. There is also a reference implementation of the bitcoin protocol that includes a wallet, known as the \"Satoshi Client\" or \"Bitcoin Core,\" which is derived from the original implementation written by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing a Bitcoin Wallet**<br>\n",
    "Bitcoin wallets are one of the most actively developed applications in the bitcoin ecosystem. There is intense competition, and while a new wallet is probably being developed right now, several wallets from last year are no longer actively maintained. Many wallets focus on specific platforms or specific uses and some are more suitable for beginners while others are filled with features for advanced users. Choosing a wallet is highly subjective and depends on the use and user expertise. It is therefore impossible to recommend a specific brand or wallet. However, we can categorize bitcoin wallets according to their platform and function and provide some clarity about all the different types of wallets that exist. Better yet, moving keys or seeds between bitcoin wallets is relatively easy, so it is worth trying out several different wallets until you find one that fits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin wallets categorization according to the platforms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Desktop wallet**<br>\n",
    "A desktop wallet was the first type of bitcoin wallet created as a reference implementation and many users run desktop wallets for the features, autonomy, and control they offer. Running on general-use operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS has certain security disadvantages however, as these platforms are often insecure and poorly configured.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mobile wallet**<br>\n",
    "A mobile wallet is the most common type of bitcoin wallet. Running on smart-phone operating systems such as Apple iOS and Android, these wallets are often a great choice for new users. Many are designed for simplicity and ease-of-use, but there are also fully featured mobile wallets for power users.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Web wallet** (Not Recommended for large amounts)<br>\n",
    "Web wallets are accessed through a web browser and store the user’s wallet on a server owned by a third party. This is similar to webmail in that it relies entirely on a third-party server. Some of these services operate using client-side code running in the user’s browser, which keeps control of the bitcoin keys in the hands of the user. Most, however, present a compromise by taking control of the bitcoin keys from users in exchange for ease-of-use. It is inadvisable to store large amounts of bitcoin on third-party systems.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hardware wallet** (Most Secure) <br>\n",
    "Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained bitcoin wallet on special-purpose hardware. They are operated via USB with a desktop web browser or via near-field-communication (NFC) on a mobile device. By handling all bitcoin-related operations on the specialized hardware, these wallets are considered very secure and suitable for storing large amounts of bitcoin.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Paper wallet** <br>\n",
    "The keys controlling bitcoin can also be printed for long-term storage. These are known as paper wallets even though other materials (wood, metal, etc.) can be used. Paper wallets offer a low-tech but highly secure means of storing bitcoin long term. Offline storage is also often referred to as cold storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin wallets categorization by their degree of autonomy and how they interact with the bitcoin network:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full-node client**<br>\n",
    "A full client, or \"full node,\" is a client that stores the entire history of bitcoin transactions (every transaction by every user, ever), manages users' wallets, and can initiate transactions directly on the bitcoin network. A full node handles all aspects of the protocol and can independently validate the entire blockchain and any transaction. A full-node client consumes substantial computer resources (e.g., more than 125 GB of disk, 2 GB of RAM) but offers complete autonomy and independent transaction verification.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lightweight client**<br>\n",
    "A lightweight client, also known as a simple-payment-verification (SPV) client, connects to bitcoin full nodes (mentioned previously) for access to the bitcoin transaction information, but stores the user wallet locally and independently creates, validates, and transmits transactions. Lightweight clients interact directly with the bitcoin network, without an intermediary.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third-party API client**<br>\n",
    "A third-party API client is one that interacts with bitcoin through a third-party system of application programming interfaces (APIs), rather than by connecting to the bitcoin network directly. The wallet may be stored by the user or by third-party servers, but all transactions go through a third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these categorizations, many bitcoin wallets fall into a few groups, with the three most common being desktop full client, mobile lightweight wallet, and web third-party wallet. The lines between different categories are often blurry, as many wallets run on multiple platforms and can interact with the network in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Start:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice, who we introduced in [Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories), is not a technical user and only recently heard about bitcoin from her friend Joe. While at a party, Joe is once again enthusiastically explaining bitcoin to all around him and is offering a demonstration. Intrigued, Alice asks how she can get started with bitcoin. Joe says that a mobile wallet is best for new users and he recommends a few of his favorite wallets. Alice downloads \"Mycelium\" for Android and installs it on her phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Alice runs Mycelium for the first time, as with many bitcoin wallets, the application automatically creates a new wallet for her. Alice sees the wallet on her screen, as shown in The Mycelium Mobile Wallet (note: do not send bitcoin to this sample address, it will be lost forever).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Mycelium.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of this screen is Alice’s **bitcoin address**. On the screen it appears as a long string of letters and numbers: 1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK. Next to the wallet’s bitcoin address is a QR code, a form of barcode that contains the same information in a format that can be scanned by a smartphone camera. The QR code is the square with a pattern of black and white dots. Alice can copy the bitcoin address or the QR code onto her clipboard by tapping the QR code, or the Receive button. In most wallets, tapping the QR code will also magnify it, so that it can be more easily scanned by a smartphone camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bitcoin addresses start with a 1 or 3. Like email addresses, they can be shared with other bitcoin users who can use them to send bitcoin directly to your wallet. There is nothing sensitive, from a security perspective, about the bitcoin address. It can be posted anywhere without risking the security of the account. Unlike email addresses, you can create new addresses as often as you like, all of which will direct funds to your wallet. In fact, many modern wallets automatically create a new address for every transaction to maximize privacy. A wallet is simply a collection of addresses and the keys that unlock the funds within.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is now ready to receive funds. Her wallet application randomly generated a private key together with its corresponding bitcoin address. At this point, her bitcoin address is not known to the bitcoin network or \"registered\" with any part of the bitcoin system. Her bitcoin address is simply a number that corresponds to a key that she can use to control access to the funds. It was generated independently by her wallet without reference or registration with any service. In fact, in most wallets, there is no association between the bitcoin address and any externally identifiable information including the user’s identity. Until the moment this address is referenced as the recipient of value in a transaction posted on the bitcoin ledger, the bitcoin address is simply part of the vast number of possible addresses that are valid in bitcoin. **Only once a bitcoin address has been associated with a transaction does it become part of the known addresses in the network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is now ready to start using her new bitcoin wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Your First Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and often most difficult task for new users is to acquire some bitcoin. Unlike other foreign currencies, you cannot yet buy bitcoin at a bank or foreign exchange kiosk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Most electronic payment networks such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and bank account transfers are reversible. For someone selling bitcoin, this difference introduces a very high risk that the buyer will reverse the electronic payment after they have received bitcoin, in effect defrauding the seller**. To mitigate this risk, companies accepting traditional electronic payments in return for bitcoin usually require buyers to undergo identity verification and credit-worthiness checks, which may take several days or weeks. As a new user, this means you cannot buy bitcoin instantly with a credit card. With a bit of patience and creative thinking, however, you won’t need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some methods for getting bitcoin as a new user:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find a friend who has bitcoin and buy some from him or her directly. Many bitcoin users start this way. This method is the least complicated. One way to meet people with bitcoin is to attend a local bitcoin meetup listed at [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/topics/bitcoin/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a classified service such as [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/) to find a seller in your area to buy bitcoin for cash in an in-person transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Earn bitcoin by selling a product or service for bitcoin. If you are a programmer, sell your programming skills. If you’re a hairdresser, cut hair for bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a bitcoin ATM in your city. A bitcoin ATM is a machine that accepts cash and sends bitcoin to your smartphone bitcoin wallet. Find a bitcoin ATM close to you using an online map from [Coin ATM Radar](http://coinatmradar.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a bitcoin currency exchange linked to your bank account. Many countries now have currency exchanges that offer a market for buyers and sellers to swap bitcoin with local currency. Exchange-rate listing services, such as [BitcoinAverage](https://bitcoinaverage.com/), often show a list of bitcoin exchanges for each currency.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the advantages of bitcoin over other payment systems is that, when used correctly, it affords users much more privacy. Acquiring, holding, and spending bitcoin does not require you to divulge sensitive and personally identifiable information to third parties. However, where bitcoin touches traditional systems, such as currency exchanges, national and international regulations often apply. In order to exchange bitcoin for your national currency, you will often be required to provide proof of identity and banking information. **Users should be aware that once a bitcoin address is attached to an identity, all associated bitcoin transactions are also easy to identify and track**. This is one reason many users choose to maintain dedicated exchange accounts unlinked to their wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was introduced to bitcoin by a friend so she has an easy way to acquire her first bitcoin. Next, we will look at how she buys bitcoin from her friend Joe and how Joe sends the bitcoin to her wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Current Price of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Alice can buy bitcoin from Joe, they have to agree on the exchange rate between bitcoin and US dollars. This brings up a common question for those new to bitcoin: **\"Who sets the bitcoin price?\" The short answer is that the price is set by markets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin, like most other currencies, has a floating exchange rate. **That means that the value of bitcoin vis-a-vis any other currency fluctuates according to supply and demand in the various markets where it is traded**. For example, the \"price\" of bitcoin in US dollars is calculated in each market based on the most recent trade of bitcoin and US dollars. As such, the price tends to fluctuate minutely several times per second. **A pricing service will aggregate the prices from several markets and calculate a volume-weighted average representing the broad market exchange rate of a currency pair (e.g., BTC/USD)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hundreds of applications and websites that can provide the current market rate. Here are some of the most popular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Bitcoin Average](https://bitcoinaverage.com/): A site that provides a simple view of the volume-weighted-average for each currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [CoinCap](http://coincap.io/): A service listing the market capitalization and exchange rates of hundreds of crypto-currencies, including bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin Reference Rate](http://bit.ly/cmebrr): A reference rate that can be used for institutional and contractual reference, provided as part of investment data feeds by the CME.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these various sites and applications, **most bitcoin wallets will automatically convert amounts between bitcoin and other currencies**. Joe will use his wallet to convert the price automatically before sending bitcoin to Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending and Receiving Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice has decided to exchange $\\$$10 US dollars for bitcoin, so as not to risk too much money on this new technology. She gives Joe $10 in cash, opens her Mycelium wallet application, and selects Receive. This displays a QR code with Alice’s first bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe then selects Send on his smartphone wallet and is presented with a screen containing two inputs:\n",
    "- A destination bitcoin address\n",
    "- The amount to send, in bitcoin (BTC) or his local currency (USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the input field for the bitcoin address, there is a small icon that looks like a QR code. This allows Joe to scan the barcode with his smartphone camera so that he doesn’t have to type in Alice’s bitcoin address, which is quite long and difficult to type. Joe taps the QR code icon and activates the smartphone camera, scanning the QR code displayed on Alice’s smartphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe now has Alice’s bitcoin address set as the recipient. Joe enters the amount as $\\$$10 US dollars and his wallet converts it by accessing the most recent exchange rate from an online service. The exchange rate at the time is $\\$$100 US dollars per bitcoin, so $\\$$10 US dollars is worth 0.10 bitcoin (BTC), or 100 millibitcoin (mBTC) as shown in the screenshot from Joe’s wallet (see Airbitz mobile bitcoin wallet send screen below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Airbitz.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe then carefully checks to make sure he has entered the correct amount, because he is about to transmit money and mistakes are irreversible. After double-checking the address and amount, he presses Send to transmit the transaction. Joe’s mobile bitcoin wallet constructs a transaction that assigns 0.10 BTC to the address provided by Alice, sourcing the funds from Joe’s wallet and signing the transaction with Joe’s private keys. This tells the bitcoin network that Joe has authorized a transfer of value to Alice’s new address. As the transaction is transmitted via the peer-to-peer protocol, it quickly propagates across the bitcoin network. In less than a second, most of the well-connected nodes in the network receive the transaction and see Alice’s address for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, Alice’s wallet is constantly \"listening\" to published transactions on the bitcoin network, looking for any that match the addresses in her wallets. A few seconds after Joe’s wallet transmits the transaction, Alice’s wallet will indicate that it is receiving 0.10 BTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confirmations\n",
    "At first, Alice’s address will show the transaction from Joe as \"Unconfirmed.\" This means that the transaction has been propagated to the network but has not yet been recorded in the bitcoin transaction ledger, known as the blockchain. **To be confirmed, a transaction must be included in a block and added to the blockchain, which happens every 10 minutes, on average. In traditional financial terms this is known as clearing.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is now the proud owner of 0.10 BTC that she can spend. Next, we will look at her first purchase with bitcoin, and examine the underlying transaction and propagation technologies in more detail.\n",

    "In the overview diagram shown below, we see that the bitcoin system consists of users with wallets containing keys, transactions that are propagated across the network, and miners who produce (through competitive computation) the consensus blockchain, which is the authoritative ledger of all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BitcoinOverview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in this section is based on an actual transaction made on the bitcoin network, simulating the interactions between the users (Joe, Alice, Bob, and Gopesh) by sending funds from one wallet to another. While tracking a transaction through the bitcoin network to the blockchain, we will use a blockchain explorer site to visualize each step. **A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as a bitcoin search engine, in that it allows you to search for addresses, transactions, and blocks and see the relationships and flows between them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular blockchain explorers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BlockCypher Explorer](https://live.blockcypher.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [blockchain.info](https://www.blockchain.com/en/explorer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BitPay Insight](https://insight.bitpay.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these has a search function that can take a bitcoin address, transaction hash, block number, or block hash and retrieve corresponding information from the bitcoin network. With each transaction or block example, we will be having a URL so we can look it up and study it in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buying a Cup of Coffee\n",
    "Alice, introduced in the previous segment, is a new user who has just acquired her first bitcoin. In [Getting Your First Bitcoin](#Getting-Your-First-Bitcoin), Alice met with her friend Joe to exchange some cash for bitcoin. The transaction created by Joe funded Alice’s wallet with 0.10 BTC. Now Alice will make her first retail transaction, buying a cup of coffee at Bob’s coffee shop in Palo Alto, California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s Cafe recently started accepting bitcoin payments by adding a bitcoin option to its point-of-sale system. The prices at Bob’s Cafe are listed in the local currency (US dollars), but at the register, customers have the option of paying in either dollars or bitcoin. Alice places her order for a cup of coffee and Bob enters it into the register, as he does for all transactions. The point-of-sale system automatically converts the total price from US dollars to bitcoin at the prevailing market rate and displays the price in both currencies: Total: 1.50 USD / 0.015 BTC. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s point-of-sale system will also automatically create a special QR code containing a payment request referred to as **Payment Request QR Code**. Unlike a QR code that simply contains a destination bitcoin address, **a payment request is a QR-encoded URL that contains a destination address, a payment amount, and a generic description such as \"Bob’s Cafe\"**. This allows a bitcoin wallet application to prefill the information used to send the payment while showing a human-readable description to the user. You can scan the QR code with a bitcoin wallet application to see what Alice would see.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PaymentQR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The payment request QR code encodes the following URL, defined in BIP-21:\n",

    "A bitcoin address: \"1GdK9UzpHBzqzX2A9JFP3Di4weBwqgmoQA\"  \n",
    "The payment amount: \"0.015\" \n",
    "A label for the recipient address: \"Bob's Cafe\" \n",
    "A description for the payment: \"Purchase at Bob's Cafe\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice uses her smartphone to scan the barcode on display. Her smartphone shows a payment of 0.0150 BTC to Bob's Cafe and she selects Send to authorize the payment. Within a few seconds (about the same amount of time as a credit card authorization), Bob sees the transaction on the register, completing the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can examine Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe on the blockchain using a block explorer site ([View Alice’s transaction on blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/tx/0627052b6f28912f2703066a912ea577f2ce4da4caa5a5fbd8a57286c345c2f2))\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will examine this transaction in more detail. We’ll see how Alice’s wallet constructed it, how it was propagated across the network, how it was verified, and finally, how Bob can spend that amount in subsequent transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The bitcoin network can transact in fractional values, e.g., from millibitcoin (1/1000th of a bitcoin) down to 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin, which is known as a satoshi. Throughout this notebook, we’ll use the term “bitcoin” to refer to any quantity of bitcoin currency, from the smallest unit (1 satoshi) to the total number (21,000,000) of all bitcoin that will ever be mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, **a transaction tells the network that the owner of some bitcoin value has authorized the transfer of that value to another owner**. The new owner can now spend the bitcoin by creating another transaction that authorizes the transfer to another owner, and so on, in a chain of ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are like lines in a double-entry bookkeeping ledger. Each transaction contains one or more \"inputs,\" which are like debits against a bitcoin account. On the other side of the transaction, there are one or more \"outputs,\" which are like credits added to a bitcoin account. **The inputs and outputs (debits and credits) do not necessarily add up to the same amount. Instead, outputs add up to slightly less than inputs and the difference represents an implied transaction fee, which is a small payment collected by the miner who includes the transaction in the ledger**. A bitcoin transaction is shown as a bookkeeping ledger entry below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransacsAsDouble-Entry.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The transaction also contains proof of ownership for each amount of bitcoin (inputs) whose value is being spent, in the form of a digital signature from the owner, which can be independently validated by anyone.** In bitcoin terms, \"spending\" is signing a transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction over to a new owner identified by a bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s payment to Bob’s Cafe uses a previous transaction’s output as its input. In the previous section, Alice received bitcoin from her friend Joe in return for cash. That transaction created a bitcoin value locked by Alice’s key. Her new transaction to Bob’s Cafe references the previous transaction as an input and creates new outputs to pay for the cup of coffee and receive change. **The transactions form a chain, where the inputs from the latest transaction correspond to outputs from previous transactions. Alice’s key provides the signature that unlocks those previous transaction outputs, thereby proving to the bitcoin network that she owns the funds**. She attaches the payment for coffee to Bob’s address, thereby \"encumbering\" that output with the requirement that Bob produces a signature in order to spend that amount. This represents a transfer of value between Alice and Bob. This chain of transactions, from Joe to Alice to Bob, is illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransactionChain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Many bitcoin transactions will include outputs that reference both an address of the new owner and an address of the current owner, called the change address. This is because transaction inputs, like currency notes, cannot be divided. If you purchase a $\\$$5 US dollar item in a store but use a $\\$$ 20 US dollar bill to pay for the item, you expect to receive $\\$$15 US dollars in change. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to bitcoin transaction inputs. **If you purchased an item that costs 5 bitcoin but only had a 20 bitcoin input to use, you would send one output of 5 bitcoin to the store owner and one output of 15 bitcoin back to yourself as change (minus any applicable transaction fee)**. Importantly, the change address does not have to be the same address as that of the input and for privacy reasons is often a new address from the owner’s wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different wallets may use different strategies when aggregating inputs to make a payment requested by the user. They might aggregate many small inputs, or use one that is equal to or larger than the desired payment. **Unless the wallet can aggregate inputs in such a way to exactly match the desired payment plus transaction fees, the wallet will need to generate some change**. This is very similar to how people handle cash. If you always use the largest bill/note in your pocket, you will end up with a pocket full of loose change. If you only use the loose change, you’ll always have only big bills. People subconsciously find a balance between these two extremes, and bitcoin wallet developers strive to program this balance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In summary, **transactions move value from transaction inputs to transaction outputs**. An input is a reference to a previous transaction’s output, showing where the value is coming from. A transaction output directs a specific value to a new owner’s bitcoin address and can include a change output back to the original owner. Outputs from one transaction can be used as inputs in a new transaction, thus creating a chain of ownership as the value is moved from owner to owner\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Transaction Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "From 1: Common Transaction:<br>The most common form of transaction is a simple payment from one address to another, which often includes some \"change\" returned to the original owner. This type of transaction has one input and two outputs as shown below:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/CommonTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "From 2: Aggregating Transaction:<br>Another common form of transaction is one that aggregates several inputs into a single output. This represents the real-world equivalent of using a pile of coins and currency notes for paying a large value. Transactions like these are sometimes generated by wallet applications to clean up lots of smaller amounts that were received as change for payments.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AggregatingTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "From 3: Distributing Transaction:<br>\n",
    "Finally, another transaction form that is seen often on the bitcoin ledger is a transaction that distributes one input to multiple outputs representing multiple recipients. This type of transaction is sometimes used by commercial entities to distribute funds, such as when processing payroll payments to multiple employees.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/DistributingTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing a Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s wallet application contains all the logic for selecting appropriate inputs and outputs to build a transaction to Alice’s specification. Alice only needs to specify a destination and an amount, and the rest happens in the wallet application without her seeing the details. Importantly, a wallet application can construct transactions even if it is completely offline. Like writing a check at home and later sending it to the bank in an envelope, the transaction does not need to be constructed and signed while connected to the bitcoin network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Right Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s wallet application will first have to find inputs that can pay the amount she wants to send to Bob. Most wallets keep track of all the available outputs belonging to addresses in the wallet. Therefore, Alice’s wallet would contain a copy of the transaction output from Joe’s transaction, which was created in exchange for cash. A bitcoin wallet application that runs as a full-node client actually contains a copy of every unspent output from every transaction in the blockchain. This allows a wallet to construct transaction inputs as well as quickly verify incoming transactions as having correct inputs. However, because a full-node client takes up a lot of disk space, most user wallets run \"lightweight\" clients that track only the user’s own unspent outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the wallet application does not maintain a copy of unspent transaction outputs, it can query the bitcoin network to retrieve this information using a variety of APIs available by different providers or by asking a full-node using an application programming interface (API) call. The image below shows an API request, constructed as an HTTP GET command to a specific URL. This URL will return all the unspent transaction outputs for an address, giving any application the information it needs to construct transaction inputs for spending. We use the simple command-line HTTP client cURL to retrieve the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/UnspentAPIRequest.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The response shows one unspent output (one that has not been redeemed yet) under the ownership of Alice’s address 1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK. The response includes the reference to the transaction in which this unspent output is contained (the payment from Joe) and its value in satoshis, at 10 million, equivalent to 0.10 bitcoin. With this information, Alice’s wallet application can construct a transaction to transfer that value to new owner addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Alice’s wallet contains enough bitcoin in a single unspent output to pay for the cup of coffee. Had this not been the case, Alice’s wallet application might have to search through a pile of smaller unspent outputs, like picking coins from a purse until it could find enough to pay for the coffee. In both cases, there might be a need to get some change back, which we'll see in the next section, as the wallet application creates the transaction outputs (payments).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction output is created in the form of a script that creates an encumbrance on the value and can only be redeemed by the introduction of a solution to the script. In simpler terms, **Alice’s transaction output will contain a script that says something like, \"This output is payable to whoever can present a signature from the key corresponding to Bob’s public address.\" Because only Bob has the wallet with the keys corresponding to that address, only Bob’s wallet can present such a signature to redeem this output**. Alice will therefore \"encumber\" the output value with a demand for a signature from Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transaction will also include a second output, because Alice’s funds are in the form of a 0.10 BTC output, too much money for the 0.015 BTC cup of coffee. Alice will need 0.085 BTC in change. Alice’s change payment is created by Alice’s wallet as an output in the very same transaction as the payment to Bob. Essentially, Alice’s wallet breaks her funds into two payments: one to Bob and one back to herself. She can then use (spend) the change output in a subsequent transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the transaction to be processed by the network in a timely fashion, Alice’s wallet application will add a small fee. This is not explicit in the transaction; it is implied by the difference between inputs and outputs. If instead of taking 0.085 in change, Alice creates only 0.0845 as the second output, there will be 0.0005 BTC (half a millibitcoin) left over. The input’s 0.10 BTC is not fully spent with the two outputs, because they will add up to less than 0.10. The resulting difference is the transaction fee that is collected by the miner as a fee for validating and including the transaction in a block to be recorded on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting transaction can be seen using a blockchain explorer web application, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AliceTransac2Bob.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the Transaction to the Ledger\n",
    "**The transaction created by Alice’s wallet application is 258 bytes long and contains everything necessary to confirm ownership of the funds and assign new owners**. Now, the transaction must be transmitted to the bitcoin network where it will become part of the blockchain. In the next section we will see how a transaction becomes part of a new block and how the block is \"mined.\" Finally, we will see how the new block, once added to the blockchain, is increasingly trusted by the network as more blocks are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transmitting the transaction\n",
    "Because the transaction contains all the information necessary to process, it does not matter how or where it is transmitted to the bitcoin network. The bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer network, with each bitcoin client participating by connecting to several other bitcoin clients. The purpose of the bitcoin network is to propagate transactions and blocks to all participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it propagates\n",
    "**Any system, such as a server, desktop application, or wallet, that participates in the bitcoin network by \"speaking\" the bitcoin protocol is called a bitcoin node**. Alice’s wallet application can send the new transaction to any bitcoin node it is connected to over any type of connection: wired, WiFi, mobile, etc. Her bitcoin wallet does not have to be connected to Bob’s bitcoin wallet directly and she does not have to use the internet connection offered by the cafe, though both those options are possible, too. **Any bitcoin node that receives a valid transaction it has not seen before will immediately forward it to all other nodes to which it is connected, a propagation technique known as flooding**. Thus, the transaction rapidly propagates out across the peer-to-peer network, reaching a large percentage of the nodes within a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bob’s view**\n",
    "\n",
    "If Bob’s bitcoin wallet application is directly connected to Alice’s wallet application, Bob’s wallet application might be the first node to receive the transaction. However, even if Alice’s wallet sends the transaction through other nodes, it will reach Bob’s wallet within a few seconds.<br> **Bob’s wallet will immediately identify Alice’s transaction as an incoming payment because it contains outputs redeemable by Bob’s keys. Bob’s wallet application can also independently verify that the transaction is well formed, uses previously unspent inputs, and contains sufficient transaction fees to be included in the next block**. At this point Bob can assume, with little risk, that the transaction will shortly be included in a block and confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A common misconception about bitcoin transactions is that they must be \"confirmed\" by waiting 10 minutes for a new block, or up to 60 minutes for a full six confirmations. Although confirmations ensure the transaction has been accepted by the whole network, such a delay is unnecessary for small-value items such as a cup of coffee. A merchant may accept a valid small-value transaction with no confirmations, with no more risk than a credit card payment made without an ID or a signature, as merchants routinely accept today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s transaction is now propagated on the bitcoin network. It does not become part of the blockchain until it is verified and included in a block by a process called mining. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The bitcoin system of trust is based on computation. Transactions are bundled into blocks, which require an enormous amount of computation to prove, but only a small amount of computation to verify as proven**. The mining process serves two purposes in bitcoin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mining nodes validate all transactions by reference to bitcoin’s consensus rules. Therefore, mining provides security for bitcoin transactions by rejecting invalid or malformed transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mining creates new bitcoin in each block, almost like a central bank printing new money. The amount of bitcoin created per block is limited and diminishes with time, following a fixed issuance schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mining achieves a fine balance between cost and reward. Mining uses electricity to solve a mathematical problem. A successful miner will collect a reward in the form of new bitcoin and transaction fees. However, the reward will only be collected if the miner has correctly validated all the transactions, to the satisfaction of the rules of consensus. This delicate balance provides security for bitcoin without a central authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mining: An Analogical Explanation**<br>\n",
    "A good way to describe mining is like a giant competitive game of sudoku that resets every time someone finds a solution and whose difficulty automatically adjusts so that it takes approximately 10 minutes to find a solution. Imagine a giant sudoku puzzle, several thousand rows and columns in size. If I show you a completed puzzle you can verify it quite quickly. However, if the puzzle has a few squares filled and the rest are empty, it takes a lot of work to solve! The difficulty of the sudoku can be adjusted by changing its size (more or fewer rows and columns), but it can still be verified quite easily even if it is very large. **The \"puzzle\" used in bitcoin is based on a cryptographic hash and exhibits similar characteristics: it is asymmetrically hard to solve but easy to verify, and its difficulty can be adjusted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories), we introduced Jing, an entrepreneur in Shanghai. Jing runs a mining farm, which is a business that runs thousands of specialized mining computers, competing for the reward. Every 10 minutes or so, Jing’s mining computers compete against thousands of similar systems in a global race to find a solution to a block of transactions. **Finding such a solution, the so-called Proof-of-Work (PoW), requires quadrillions of hashing operations per second across the entire bitcoin network. The algorithm for Proof-of-Work involves repeatedly hashing the header of the block and a random number with the SHA256 cryptographic algorithm until a solution matching a predetermined pattern emerges**. The first miner to find such a solution wins the round of competition and publishes that block into the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jing started mining in 2010 using a very fast desktop computer to find a suitable Proof-of-Work for new blocks. As more miners started joining the bitcoin network, the difficulty of the problem increased rapidly. Soon, Jing and other miners upgraded to more specialized hardware, such as high-end dedicated graphical processing units (GPUs) cards such as those used in gaming desktops or consoles. At the time of this writing, the difficulty is so high that it is profitable only to mine with application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), essentially hundreds of mining algorithms printed in hardware, running in parallel on a single silicon chip. Jing’s company also participates in a mining pool, which much like a lottery pool allows several participants to share their efforts and rewards. Jing’s company now runs a warehouse containing thousands of ASIC miners to mine for bitcoin 24 hours a day. The company pays its electricity costs by selling the bitcoin it is able to generate from mining, creating some income from the profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mining Transactions in Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "New transactions are constantly flowing into the network from user wallets and other applications. As these are seen by the bitcoin network nodes, they get added to a temporary pool of unverified transactions maintained by each node. **As miners construct a new block, they add unverified transactions from this pool to the new block and then attempt to prove the validity of that new block, with the mining algorithm (Proof-of-Work).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are added to the new block, prioritized by the highest-fee transactions first and a few other criteria. <br>**Each miner starts the process of mining a new block of transactions as soon as he receives the previous block from the network, knowing he has lost that previous round of competition. He immediately creates a new block, fills it with transactions and the fingerprint of the previous block, and starts calculating the Proof-of-Work for the new block. Each miner includes a special transaction in his block, one that pays his own bitcoin address the block reward (currently 12.5 newly created bitcoin) plus the sum of transaction fees from all the transactions included in the block. If he finds a solution that makes that block valid, he \"wins\" this reward because his successful block is added to the global blockchain and the reward transaction he included becomes spendable**.<br> Jing, who participates in a mining pool, has set up his software to create new blocks that assign the reward to a pool address. From there, a share of the reward is distributed to Jing and other miners in proportion to the amount of work they contributed in the last round.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s transaction was picked up by the network and included in the pool of unverified transactions. Once validated by the mining software it was included in a new block, called a candidate block, generated by Jing’s mining pool. All the miners participating in that mining pool immediately start computing Proof-of-Work for the candidate block. Approximately five minutes after the transaction was first transmitted by Alice’s wallet, one of Jing’s ASIC miners found a solution for the candidate block and announced it to the network. Once other miners validated the winning block they started the race to generate the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the block that includes [Alice's Transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/block-height/277316)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jing’s winning block became part of the blockchain as block #277316, containing 419 transactions, including Alice’s transaction. **The block containing Alice’s transaction is counted as one \"confirmation\" of that transaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 19 minutes later, a new block, #277317, is mined by another miner. Because this new block is built on top of block #277316 that contained Alice’s transaction, it added even more computation to the blockchain, thereby strengthening the trust in those transactions. **Each block mined on top of the one containing the transaction counts as an additional confirmation for Alice’s transaction. As the blocks pile on top of each other, it becomes exponentially harder to reverse the transaction, thereby making it more and more trusted by the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AlicesTransacInBlock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram we can see block #277316, which contains Alice’s transaction. Below it are 277,316 blocks (including block #0), linked to each other in a chain of blocks (blockchain) all the way back to block #0, known as the **genesis block**. Over time, **as the \"height\" in blocks increases, so does the computation difficulty for each block and the chain as a whole**. The blocks mined after the one that contains Alice’s transaction act as further assurance, as they pile on more computation in a longer and longer chain. **By convention, any block with more than six confirmations is considered irrevocable, because it would require an immense amount of computation to invalidate and recalculate six blocks**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pool Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooled mining is a mining approach where multiple generating clients contribute to the generation of a block, and then split the block reward according the contributed processing power. Pooled mining effectively reduces the granularity of the block generation reward, spreading it out more smoothly over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mining pool coordinates the workers. Think of it like a lottery. If you and your friends all buy tickets in the lottery the group has a better chance of winning i.e. **pool mining elevates the probability of successful generation of a block**. To be fair in the lottery example everyone should be rewarded proportional to the amount of money spent on tickets. So if there are 20 tickets for the pool one person purchased 10 and two people purchased 5 each - if one of the 20 tickets win the person who purchased 10 gets 50% and the other two get 25% each.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a mining pool does is function as a coordinator for all the pool participants doing:\n",
    "- Taking the pool members hashes\n",
    "- Looking for block rewards\n",
    "- Recording how much work all the participants are doing\n",
    "- Assigning block rewards proportionally to participants contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Miners mine differently by running pool software instead of the bitcoin client and just performing hashes for the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spending the Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that Alice’s transaction has been embedded in the blockchain as part of a block, it is part of the distributed ledger of bitcoin and visible to all bitcoin applications. Each bitcoin client can independently verify the transaction as valid and spendable.<br> **Full-node clients can track the source of the funds from the moment a given bitcoin(s) was first generated in a block, incrementally from transaction to transaction, until they reach Bob’s address. Lightweight clients can do what is called a simplified payment verification by confirming that the transaction is in the blockchain and has several blocks mined after it, thus providing assurance that the miners accepted it as valid**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob can now spend the output from this and other transactions. For example, Bob can pay a contractor or supplier by transferring value from Alice’s coffee cup payment to these new owners. Most likely, Bob’s bitcoin software will aggregate many small payments into a larger payment, perhaps concentrating all the day’s bitcoin revenue into a single transaction. This would aggregate the various payments into a single output (and a single address).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Bob spends the payments received from Alice and other customers, he extends the chain of transactions. Let’s assume that Bob pays his web designer Gopesh in Bangalore for a new website page. Now the chain of transactions will look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ABG-TransactionChain.png)\n",
    "Note: The Inputs and Outputs don't have the names of the entities participating in transactions, rather the inputs and outputs fields contains the addresses to the bitcoin wallets of the senders and the receivers respectively (notice that the addresses aren't linked to sender's and receiver's identity, therefore, provides anonymity).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To this moment, we saw how transactions build a chain that moves value from owner to owner. We also tracked Alice’s transaction, from the moment it was created in her wallet, through the bitcoin network and to the miners who recorded it on the blockchain. In the rest of this notebook, we will examine the specific technologies behind wallets, addresses, signatures, transactions, the network, and finally mining.\n",

    "# Keys, Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard that bitcoin is based on cryptography, which is a branch of mathematics used extensively in computer security. Cryptography means \"secret writing\" in Greek, but the science of cryptography encompasses more than just secret writing, which is referred to as encryption. Cryptography can also be used to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing that secret (digital signature), or prove the authenticity of data (digital fingerprint). These types of cryptographic proofs are the mathematical tools critical to bitcoin and used extensively in bitcoin applications. **Ironically, encryption is not an important part of bitcoin, as its communications and transaction data are not encrypted and do not need to be encrypted to protect the funds.** In this section we will introduce some of the cryptography used in bitcoin to control ownership of funds, in the form of keys, addresses, and wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ownership of bitcoin is established through digital keys, bitcoin addresses, and digital signatures**. The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but are instead created and stored by users in a file, or simple database, called a wallet. **The digital keys in a user’s wallet are completely independent of the bitcoin protocol and can be generated and managed by the user’s wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the internet**. Keys enable many of the interesting properties of bitcoin, including decentralized trust and control, ownership attestation, and the cryptographic-proof security model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Most bitcoin transactions require a valid digital signature to be included in the blockchain, which can only be generated with a secret key; therefore, anyone with a copy of that key has control of the bitcoin. The digital signature used to spend funds is also referred to as a witness, a term used in cryptography. The witness data in a bitcoin transaction serves as an evidence of the true ownership of the funds being spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key**. Think of the public key as similar to a bank account number and the private key as similar to the secret PIN, or signature on a check, that provides control over the account. These digital keys are very rarely seen by the users of bitcoin. For the most part, they are stored inside the wallet file and managed by the bitcoin wallet software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the payment portion of a bitcoin transaction, **the recipient’s public key is represented by its digital fingerprint, called a bitcoin address**, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary name on a check (i.e., \"Pay to the order of\"). **In most cases, a bitcoin address is generated from and corresponds to a public key**. However, not all bitcoin addresses represent public keys; they can also represent other beneficiaries such as scripts, as we will see later in this section. This way, bitcoin addresses abstract the recipient of funds, making transaction destinations flexible, similar to paper checks: a single payment instrument that can be used to pay into people’s accounts, pay into company accounts, pay for bills, or pay to cash. The bitcoin address is the only representation of the keys that users will routinely see, because this is the part they need to share with the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will introduce cryptography and explain the mathematics used in bitcoin. Next, we will look at how keys are generated, stored, and managed. We will review the various encoding formats used to represent private and public keys, addresses, and script addresses. Finally, we will look at advanced use of keys and addresses: vanity, multisignature, and script addresses and paper wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Key Cryptography and Cryptocurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key cryptography was invented in the 1970s and is a mathematical foundation for computer and information security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the invention of public key cryptography, several suitable mathematical functions, such as prime number exponentiation and elliptic curve multiplication, have been discovered. **These mathematical functions are practically irreversible, meaning that they are easy to calculate in one direction and infeasible to calculate in the opposite direction (One-way Functions)**. Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures. **Bitcoin uses elliptic curve multiplication as the basis for its cryptography**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In bitcoin, we use public key cryptography to create a key pair that controls access to bitcoin. The key pair consists of a private key and—​derived from it—​a unique public key. **The public key is used to receive funds, and the private key is used to sign transactions to spend the funds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a mathematical relationship between the public and the private key that allows the private key to be used to generate signatures on messages. This signature can be validated against the public key without revealing the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When spending bitcoin, the current bitcoin owner presents her public key and a signature (different each time, but created from the same private key) in a transaction to spend those bitcoin**. Through the presentation of the public key and signature, everyone in the bitcoin network can verify and accept the transaction as valid, confirming that the person transferring the bitcoin owned them at the time of the transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In most wallet implementations, the private and public keys are stored together as a key pair for convenience. However, the public key can be calculated from the private key, so storing only the private key is also possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private and Public Keys\n",
    "A bitcoin wallet contains a collection of key pairs, each consisting of a private key and a public key. \n",
    "- The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at random. \n",
    "- From the private key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a public key (K).\n",
    "- From the public key (K), we use a one-way cryptographic hash function to generate a bitcoin address (A). That's why a bitcoin address is some times referred to as a digital fingerprint of the public key. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will start with generating the private key, look at the elliptic curve math that is used to turn that into a public key, and finally, generate a bitcoin address from the public key. The relationship between private key, public key, and bitcoin address is shown below:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why Use Asymmetric Cryptography (Public/Private Keys)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is asymmetric cryptography used in bitcoin? It’s not used to \"encrypt\" (make secret) the transactions. Rather, the useful property of asymmetric cryptography is the ability to generate digital signatures. **A private key can be applied to the digital fingerprint of a transaction to produce a numerical signature. This signature can only be produced by someone with knowledge of the private key. However, anyone with access to the public key and the transaction fingerprint can use them to verify the signature**. This useful property of asymmetric cryptography makes it possible for anyone to verify every signature on every transaction, while ensuring that only the owners of private keys can produce valid signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "A private key is simply a number, picked at random. Ownership and control over the private key is the root of user control over all funds associated with the corresponding bitcoin address. The private key is used to create signatures that are required to spend bitcoin by proving ownership of funds used in a transaction. **The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the bitcoin secured by that key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss, because if it’s lost it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are forever lost, too.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The bitcoin private key is just a number. You can pick your private keys randomly using just a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256 times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you can use in a bitcoin wallet. The public key can then be generated from the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a private key from a random number\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness**. Creating a bitcoin key is essentially the same as \"Pick a number between 1 and $2^{256}$.\" The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or repeatable. **Bitcoin software uses the underlying operating system’s random number generators to produce 256 bits of entropy (randomness)**. Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the private key can be any number between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, where n is a constant (n = 1.1578 * 1077, slightly less than $2^{256}$) defined as the order of the elliptic curve used in bitcoin (see Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained). To create such a key, we randomly pick a 256-bit number and check that it is less than n. **In programming terms, this is usually achieved by feeding a larger string of random bits, collected from a cryptographically secure source of randomness, into the SHA-256 hash algorithm, which will conveniently produce a 256-bit number.** If the result is less than n, we have a suitable private key. Otherwise, we simply try again with another random number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: \n",
    ">Do not write your own code to create a random number or use a \"simple\" random number generator offered by your programming language. **Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) with a seed from a source of sufficient entropy**. Study the documentation of the random number generator library you choose to make sure it is cryptographically secure. **Correct implementation of the CSPRNG is critical to the security of the keys.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "The public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication, which is irreversible: K = k * G, where k is the private key, G is a constant point called the generator point, and K is the resulting public key. The reverse operation, known as \"finding the discrete logarithm\"—calculating k if you know K—is as difficult as trying all possible values of k, i.e., a brute-force search. Before we demonstrate how to generate a public key from a private key, let’s look at elliptic curve cryptography in a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Elliptic curve multiplication is a type of function that cryptographers call a \"trap door\" function: it is easy to do in one direction (multiplication) and impossible to do in the reverse direction (division). The owner of the private key can easily create the public key and then share it with the world knowing that no one can reverse the function and calculate the private key from the public key. This mathematical trick becomes the basis for unforgeable and secure digital signatures that prove ownership of bitcoin funds.\n",

    "\n",
    "Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of asymmetric or public key cryptography based on the discrete logarithm problem as expressed by addition and multiplication on the points of an elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EllipticCurve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin uses a specific elliptic curve and set of mathematical constants, as defined in a standard called secp256k1, established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The secp256k1 curve is defined by the following function, which produces an elliptic curve:<br>\n",
    "$\\begin{equation} {y^2 = (x^3 + 7)}~\\text{over}~(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\end{equation}$ <br>\n",
    "or<br>\n",
    "$\\begin{equation} {y^2 \\mod p = (x^3 + 7) \\mod p} \\end{equation}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mod p (modulo prime number p) indicates that this curve is over a finite field of prime order p, also written as \n",
    "$\\mathbb{F}_p$, where p = $2^{256}$ – $2^{32}$ – $2^{9}$ – $2^8$ – $2^7$ – $2^6$ – $2^4$ – 1, a very large prime number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this curve is defined over a finite field of prime order instead of over the real numbers, it looks like a pattern of dots scattered in two dimensions, which makes it difficult to visualize. However, the math is identical to that of an elliptic curve over real numbers. As an example, visualizing an elliptic curve over F(p), with p=17 below shows the same elliptic curve over a much smaller finite field of prime order 17, showing a pattern of dots on a grid. The secp256k1 bitcoin elliptic curve can be thought of as a much more complex pattern of dots on a unfathomably large grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EllipticCurvep=17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, the following is a point P with coordinates (x,y) that is a point on the secp256k1 curve:<br>\n",
    "P = (55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240, 32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elliptic Curve Math**\n",
    "\n",
    "In elliptic curve math, there is a point called the **\"point at infinity,\"** which roughly corresponds to the role of zero in addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a + operator, called \"addition,\" which has some properties similar to the traditional addition of real numbers that gradeschool children learn. Given two points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 + P2, also on the elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, this third point P3 is calculated by drawing a line between P1 and P2. This line will intersect the elliptic curve in exactly one additional place. Call this point P3' = (x, y). Then reflect in the x-axis to get P3 = (x, –y).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of special cases that explain the need for the \"point at infinity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If P1 and P2 are the same point, the line \"between\" P1 and P2 should extend to be the tangent on the curve at this point P1. This tangent will intersect the curve in exactly one new point. You can use techniques from calculus to determine the slope of the tangent line. These techniques curiously work, even though we are restricting our interest to points on the curve with two integer coordinates!\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases (i.e., if P1 and P2 have the same x values but different y values), the tangent line will be exactly vertical, in which case P3 = \"point at infinity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If P1 is the \"point at infinity,\" then P1 + P2 = P2. Similarly, if P2 is the point at infinity, then P1 + P2 = P1. This shows how the point at infinity plays the role of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that + is associative, which means that (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). That means we can write A + B + C without parentheses and without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined addition, we can define multiplication in the standard way that extends addition. For a point P on the elliptic curve, if k is a whole number, then kP = P + P + P + …​ + P (k times). Note that k is sometimes confusingly called an \"exponent\" in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a Public Key\n",
    "- Starting with a private key in the form of a randomly generated number k, we multiply it by a predetermined point on the curve called the generator point G to produce another point somewhere else on the curve, which is the corresponding public key K. \n",
    "- The generator point is specified as part of the secp256k1 standard and is always the same for all keys in bitcoin: $\\begin{equation} {K = k * G} \\end{equation}$ where k is the private key, G is the generator point, and K is the resulting public key, a point on the curve.\n",
    "- Because the generator point is always the same for all bitcoin users, a private key k multiplied with G will always result in the same public key K. The relationship between k and K is fixed, but can only be calculated in one direction, from k to K. That’s why a bitcoin address (derived from K) can be shared with anyone and does not reveal the user’s private key (k)."
