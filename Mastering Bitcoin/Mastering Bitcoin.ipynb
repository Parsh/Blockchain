    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Bitcoin?\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Bitcoin, apart from being the name of a cryptocurrency, is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem**. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. The bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin are entirely virtual. There are no physical coins or even digital coins per se. The coins are implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient. **Users of bitcoin own keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin network. With these keys they can sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner**. Keys are often stored in a digital wallet on each user’s computer or smartphone. **Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin**, putting the control entirely in the hands of each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can it be used for?<br>\n",
    "Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, including buy and sell goods, send money to people or organizations, or extend credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Bitcoins are created? [Overview]\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a distributed, peer-to-peer system. As such there is no \"central\" server or point of control.<br> **Bitcoin are created through a process called mining, which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions. Any participant in the bitcoin network (i.e., anyone using a device running the full bitcoin protocol stack) may operate as a miner, using their computer’s processing power to verify and record transactions**.<br> Every 10 minutes, on average, a bitcoin miner is able to validate the transactions of the past 10 minutes and is rewarded with brand new bitcoin. Essentially, bitcoin mining decentralizes the currency-issuance and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces the need for any central bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin protocol includes built-in algorithms that regulate the mining function across the network. The difficulty of the processing task that miners must perform is adjusted dynamically so that, on average, someone succeeds every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners (and how much processing) are competing at any moment. **The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoin are created every 4 years, and limits the total number of bitcoin that will be created to a fixed total just below 21 million coins.** The result is that the number of bitcoin in circulation closely follows an easily predictable curve that approaches 21 million by the year 2140. Due to bitcoin’s diminishing rate of issuance, over the long term, the bitcoin currency is deflationary. Furthermore, bitcoin cannot be inflated by \"printing\" new money above and beyond the expected issuance rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, bitcoin is also the name of the protocol, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed computing innovation. The bitcoin currency is really only the first application of this invention. Bitcoin represents the culmination of decades of research in cryptography and distributed systems and includes four key innovations brought together in a unique and powerful combination. Bitcoin consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bitcoin Protocol**: A decentralized peer-to-peer network <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blockchain**: A public transaction ledger <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consensus Rules**: A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proof-of-Work Algorithm**: A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is akin to the internet of money, a network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Currencies Before Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence of viable digital money is closely linked to developments in cryptography. This is not surprising when one considers the fundamental challenges involved with using bits to represent value that can be exchanged for goods and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three basic questions for anyone accepting digital money are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I trust that the money is authentic and not counterfeit?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I trust that the digital money can only be spent once (known as the “double-spend” problem)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I be sure that no one else can claim this money belongs to them and not me?**\n",
    "\n",
    "How Paper Money addresses these issues:<br>\n",
    "Issuers of paper money are constantly battling the counterfeiting problem by using increasingly sophisticated papers and printing technology. Physical money addresses the double-spend issue easily because the same paper note cannot be in two places at once. Of course, conventional money is also often stored and transmitted digitally. In these cases, the counterfeiting and double-spend issues are handled by clearing all electronic transactions through central authorities that have a global view of the currency in circulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "How Digital Money address them:<br>\n",
    "For digital money, which cannot take advantage of esoteric inks or holographic strips, **cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user’s claim to value. Specifically, cryptographic digital signatures enable a user to sign a digital asset or transaction proving the ownership of that asset**. With the appropriate architecture, digital signatures also can be used to address the double-spend issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The History of Digital Currencies\n",
    "\n",
    "When cryptography started becoming more broadly available and understood in the late 1980s, many researchers began trying to use cryptography to build digital currencies. These early digital currency projects issued digital money, usually backed by a national currency or precious metal such as gold. Although these earlier digital currencies worked, **they were centralized** and, as a result, were easy to attack by governments and hackers. **Early digital currencies used a central clearinghouse to settle all transactions at regular intervals, just like a traditional banking system**. Unfortunately, in most cases these nascent digital currencies were targeted by worried governments and eventually litigated out of existence. Some failed in spectacular crashes when the parent company liquidated abruptly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be robust against intervention by antagonists, whether legitimate governments or criminal elements, a decentralized digital currency was needed to avoid a single point of attack. **Bitcoin is such a system, decentralized by design, and free of any central authority or point of control that can be attacked or corrupted.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin was invented in 2008 with the publication of a paper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" written under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto (see [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)). Nakamoto combined several prior inventions such as b-money and HashCash to create a completely decentralized electronic cash system that does not rely on a central authority for currency issuance or settlement and validation of transactions.<br> **The key innovation was to use a distributed computation system (called a \"Proof-of-Work\" algorithm) to conduct a global \"election\" every 10 minutes, allowing the decentralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions. This elegantly solves the issue of double-spend where a single currency unit can be spent twice.** Previously, the double-spend problem was a weakness of digital currency and was addressed by clearing all transactions through a central clearinghouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin network started in 2009, based on a reference implementation published by Nakamoto and since revised by many other programmers. **The implementation of the Proof-of-Work algorithm (mining) that provides security and resilience for bitcoin has increased in power exponentially, and now exceeds the combined processing power of the world’s top supercomputers**. Bitcoin’s total market value has at times exceeded 135 billion US dollars, depending on the bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate. The largest transaction processed so far by the network was 400 million US dollars, transmitted instantly and processed for a fee of 1 US dollar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from the public in April 2011, leaving the responsibility of developing the code and network to a thriving group of volunteers. The identity of the person or people behind bitcoin is still unknown. However, neither Satoshi Nakamoto nor anyone else exerts individual control over the bitcoin system, which operates based on fully transparent mathematical principles, open source code, and consensus among participants. The invention itself is groundbreaking and has already spawned new science in the fields of distributed computing, economics, and econometrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Solution to a Distributed Computing Problem (Byzantine Generals' Problem)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention is also a practical and novel solution to a problem in distributed computing, known as the \"Byzantine Generals' Problem.\" Briefly, the problem consists of trying to agree on a course of action or the state of a system by exchanging information over an unreliable and potentially compromised network. **Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution, which uses the concept of Proof-of-Work to achieve consensus without a central trusted authority, represents a breakthrough in distributed computing and has wide applicability beyond currency**. It can be used to achieve consensus on decentralized networks to prove the fairness of elections, lotteries, asset registries, digital notarization, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is an innovation in the ancient technology of money. At its core, money simply facilitates the exchange of value between people. Therefore, in order to fully understand bitcoin and its uses, we’ll examine it from the perspective of people using it. Each of the people and their stories, as listed here, illustrates one or more specific use cases. We’ll be seeing them throughout the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **North American low-value retail**<br>\n",
    "Alice lives in Northern California’s Bay Area. She has heard about bitcoin from her techie friends and wants to start using it. We will follow her story as she learns about bitcoin, acquires some, and then spends some of her bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee at Bob’s Cafe in Palo Alto. This story will introduce us to the software, the exchanges, and basic transactions from the perspective of a retail consumer.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **North American high-value retail**<br>\n",

    "Jing is a computer engineering student in Shanghai. He has built a \"mining\" rig to mine for bitcoin using his engineering skills to supplement his income. This story will examine the \"industrial\" base of bitcoin: the specialized equipment used to secure the bitcoin network and issue new currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these stories is based on the real people and real industries currently using bitcoin to create new markets, new industries, and innovative solutions to global economic issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin is a protocol that can be accessed using a client application that speaks the protocol**. A **\"bitcoin wallet\"** is the most common user interface to the bitcoin system, just like a web browser is the most common user interface for the HTTP protocol. There are many implementations and brands of bitcoin wallets, just like there are many brands of web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer). And just like we all have our favorite browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Yay!) and our villains (Internet Explorer, Yuck!), bitcoin wallets vary in quality, performance, security, privacy, and reliability. There is also a reference implementation of the bitcoin protocol that includes a wallet, known as the \"Satoshi Client\" or \"Bitcoin Core,\" which is derived from the original implementation written by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing a Bitcoin Wallet**<br>\n",
    "Bitcoin wallets are one of the most actively developed applications in the bitcoin ecosystem. There is intense competition, and while a new wallet is probably being developed right now, several wallets from last year are no longer actively maintained. Many wallets focus on specific platforms or specific uses and some are more suitable for beginners while others are filled with features for advanced users. Choosing a wallet is highly subjective and depends on the use and user expertise. It is therefore impossible to recommend a specific brand or wallet. However, we can categorize bitcoin wallets according to their platform and function and provide some clarity about all the different types of wallets that exist. Better yet, moving keys or seeds between bitcoin wallets is relatively easy, so it is worth trying out several different wallets until you find one that fits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin wallets categorization according to the platforms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Desktop wallet**<br>\n",
    "A desktop wallet was the first type of bitcoin wallet created as a reference implementation and many users run desktop wallets for the features, autonomy, and control they offer. Running on general-use operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS has certain security disadvantages however, as these platforms are often insecure and poorly configured.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mobile wallet**<br>\n",
    "A mobile wallet is the most common type of bitcoin wallet. Running on smart-phone operating systems such as Apple iOS and Android, these wallets are often a great choice for new users. Many are designed for simplicity and ease-of-use, but there are also fully featured mobile wallets for power users.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Web wallet** (Not Recommended for large amounts)<br>\n",
    "Web wallets are accessed through a web browser and store the user’s wallet on a server owned by a third party. This is similar to webmail in that it relies entirely on a third-party server. Some of these services operate using client-side code running in the user’s browser, which keeps control of the bitcoin keys in the hands of the user. Most, however, present a compromise by taking control of the bitcoin keys from users in exchange for ease-of-use. It is inadvisable to store large amounts of bitcoin on third-party systems.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hardware wallet** (Most Secure) <br>\n",
    "Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained bitcoin wallet on special-purpose hardware. They are operated via USB with a desktop web browser or via near-field-communication (NFC) on a mobile device. By handling all bitcoin-related operations on the specialized hardware, these wallets are considered very secure and suitable for storing large amounts of bitcoin.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Paper wallet** <br>\n",
    "The keys controlling bitcoin can also be printed for long-term storage. These are known as paper wallets even though other materials (wood, metal, etc.) can be used. Paper wallets offer a low-tech but highly secure means of storing bitcoin long term. Offline storage is also often referred to as cold storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin wallets categorization by their degree of autonomy and how they interact with the bitcoin network:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full-node client**<br>\n",
    "A full client, or \"full node,\" is a client that stores the entire history of bitcoin transactions (every transaction by every user, ever), manages users' wallets, and can initiate transactions directly on the bitcoin network. A full node handles all aspects of the protocol and can independently validate the entire blockchain and any transaction. A full-node client consumes substantial computer resources (e.g., more than 125 GB of disk, 2 GB of RAM) but offers complete autonomy and independent transaction verification.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lightweight client**<br>\n",
    "A lightweight client, also known as a simple-payment-verification (SPV) client, connects to bitcoin full nodes (mentioned previously) for access to the bitcoin transaction information, but stores the user wallet locally and independently creates, validates, and transmits transactions. Lightweight clients interact directly with the bitcoin network, without an intermediary.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third-party API client**<br>\n",
    "A third-party API client is one that interacts with bitcoin through a third-party system of application programming interfaces (APIs), rather than by connecting to the bitcoin network directly. The wallet may be stored by the user or by third-party servers, but all transactions go through a third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these categorizations, many bitcoin wallets fall into a few groups, with the three most common being desktop full client, mobile lightweight wallet, and web third-party wallet. The lines between different categories are often blurry, as many wallets run on multiple platforms and can interact with the network in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Start:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice, who we introduced in [Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories), is not a technical user and only recently heard about bitcoin from her friend Joe. While at a party, Joe is once again enthusiastically explaining bitcoin to all around him and is offering a demonstration. Intrigued, Alice asks how she can get started with bitcoin. Joe says that a mobile wallet is best for new users and he recommends a few of his favorite wallets. Alice downloads \"Mycelium\" for Android and installs it on her phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Alice runs Mycelium for the first time, as with many bitcoin wallets, the application automatically creates a new wallet for her. Alice sees the wallet on her screen, as shown in The Mycelium Mobile Wallet (note: do not send bitcoin to this sample address, it will be lost forever).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Mycelium.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of this screen is Alice’s **bitcoin address**. On the screen it appears as a long string of letters and numbers: 1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK. Next to the wallet’s bitcoin address is a QR code, a form of barcode that contains the same information in a format that can be scanned by a smartphone camera. The QR code is the square with a pattern of black and white dots. Alice can copy the bitcoin address or the QR code onto her clipboard by tapping the QR code, or the Receive button. In most wallets, tapping the QR code will also magnify it, so that it can be more easily scanned by a smartphone camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bitcoin addresses start with a 1 or 3. Like email addresses, they can be shared with other bitcoin users who can use them to send bitcoin directly to your wallet. There is nothing sensitive, from a security perspective, about the bitcoin address. It can be posted anywhere without risking the security of the account. Unlike email addresses, you can create new addresses as often as you like, all of which will direct funds to your wallet. In fact, many modern wallets automatically create a new address for every transaction to maximize privacy. A wallet is simply a collection of addresses and the keys that unlock the funds within.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is now ready to receive funds. Her wallet application randomly generated a private key together with its corresponding bitcoin address. At this point, her bitcoin address is not known to the bitcoin network or \"registered\" with any part of the bitcoin system. Her bitcoin address is simply a number that corresponds to a key that she can use to control access to the funds. It was generated independently by her wallet without reference or registration with any service. In fact, in most wallets, there is no association between the bitcoin address and any externally identifiable information including the user’s identity. Until the moment this address is referenced as the recipient of value in a transaction posted on the bitcoin ledger, the bitcoin address is simply part of the vast number of possible addresses that are valid in bitcoin. **Only once a bitcoin address has been associated with a transaction does it become part of the known addresses in the network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is now ready to start using her new bitcoin wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Your First Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and often most difficult task for new users is to acquire some bitcoin. Unlike other foreign currencies, you cannot yet buy bitcoin at a bank or foreign exchange kiosk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Most electronic payment networks such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and bank account transfers are reversible. For someone selling bitcoin, this difference introduces a very high risk that the buyer will reverse the electronic payment after they have received bitcoin, in effect defrauding the seller**. To mitigate this risk, companies accepting traditional electronic payments in return for bitcoin usually require buyers to undergo identity verification and credit-worthiness checks, which may take several days or weeks. As a new user, this means you cannot buy bitcoin instantly with a credit card. With a bit of patience and creative thinking, however, you won’t need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some methods for getting bitcoin as a new user:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find a friend who has bitcoin and buy some from him or her directly. Many bitcoin users start this way. This method is the least complicated. One way to meet people with bitcoin is to attend a local bitcoin meetup listed at [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/topics/bitcoin/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a classified service such as [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/) to find a seller in your area to buy bitcoin for cash in an in-person transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Earn bitcoin by selling a product or service for bitcoin. If you are a programmer, sell your programming skills. If you’re a hairdresser, cut hair for bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a bitcoin ATM in your city. A bitcoin ATM is a machine that accepts cash and sends bitcoin to your smartphone bitcoin wallet. Find a bitcoin ATM close to you using an online map from [Coin ATM Radar](http://coinatmradar.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a bitcoin currency exchange linked to your bank account. Many countries now have currency exchanges that offer a market for buyers and sellers to swap bitcoin with local currency. Exchange-rate listing services, such as [BitcoinAverage](https://bitcoinaverage.com/), often show a list of bitcoin exchanges for each currency.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the advantages of bitcoin over other payment systems is that, when used correctly, it affords users much more privacy. Acquiring, holding, and spending bitcoin does not require you to divulge sensitive and personally identifiable information to third parties. However, where bitcoin touches traditional systems, such as currency exchanges, national and international regulations often apply. In order to exchange bitcoin for your national currency, you will often be required to provide proof of identity and banking information. **Users should be aware that once a bitcoin address is attached to an identity, all associated bitcoin transactions are also easy to identify and track**. This is one reason many users choose to maintain dedicated exchange accounts unlinked to their wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was introduced to bitcoin by a friend so she has an easy way to acquire her first bitcoin. Next, we will look at how she buys bitcoin from her friend Joe and how Joe sends the bitcoin to her wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Current Price of Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Alice can buy bitcoin from Joe, they have to agree on the exchange rate between bitcoin and US dollars. This brings up a common question for those new to bitcoin: **\"Who sets the bitcoin price?\" The short answer is that the price is set by markets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin, like most other currencies, has a floating exchange rate. **That means that the value of bitcoin vis-a-vis any other currency fluctuates according to supply and demand in the various markets where it is traded**. For example, the \"price\" of bitcoin in US dollars is calculated in each market based on the most recent trade of bitcoin and US dollars. As such, the price tends to fluctuate minutely several times per second. **A pricing service will aggregate the prices from several markets and calculate a volume-weighted average representing the broad market exchange rate of a currency pair (e.g., BTC/USD)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hundreds of applications and websites that can provide the current market rate. Here are some of the most popular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Bitcoin Average](https://bitcoinaverage.com/): A site that provides a simple view of the volume-weighted-average for each currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [CoinCap](http://coincap.io/): A service listing the market capitalization and exchange rates of hundreds of crypto-currencies, including bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin Reference Rate](http://bit.ly/cmebrr): A reference rate that can be used for institutional and contractual reference, provided as part of investment data feeds by the CME.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these various sites and applications, **most bitcoin wallets will automatically convert amounts between bitcoin and other currencies**. Joe will use his wallet to convert the price automatically before sending bitcoin to Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending and Receiving Bitcoin\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice has decided to exchange $\\$$10 US dollars for bitcoin, so as not to risk too much money on this new technology. She gives Joe $10 in cash, opens her Mycelium wallet application, and selects Receive. This displays a QR code with Alice’s first bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe then selects Send on his smartphone wallet and is presented with a screen containing two inputs:\n",
    "- A destination bitcoin address\n",
    "- The amount to send, in bitcoin (BTC) or his local currency (USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the input field for the bitcoin address, there is a small icon that looks like a QR code. This allows Joe to scan the barcode with his smartphone camera so that he doesn’t have to type in Alice’s bitcoin address, which is quite long and difficult to type. Joe taps the QR code icon and activates the smartphone camera, scanning the QR code displayed on Alice’s smartphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe now has Alice’s bitcoin address set as the recipient. Joe enters the amount as $\\$$10 US dollars and his wallet converts it by accessing the most recent exchange rate from an online service. The exchange rate at the time is $\\$$100 US dollars per bitcoin, so $\\$$10 US dollars is worth 0.10 bitcoin (BTC), or 100 millibitcoin (mBTC) as shown in the screenshot from Joe’s wallet (see Airbitz mobile bitcoin wallet send screen below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Airbitz.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe then carefully checks to make sure he has entered the correct amount, because he is about to transmit money and mistakes are irreversible. After double-checking the address and amount, he presses Send to transmit the transaction. Joe’s mobile bitcoin wallet constructs a transaction that assigns 0.10 BTC to the address provided by Alice, sourcing the funds from Joe’s wallet and signing the transaction with Joe’s private keys. This tells the bitcoin network that Joe has authorized a transfer of value to Alice’s new address. As the transaction is transmitted via the peer-to-peer protocol, it quickly propagates across the bitcoin network. In less than a second, most of the well-connected nodes in the network receive the transaction and see Alice’s address for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, Alice’s wallet is constantly \"listening\" to published transactions on the bitcoin network, looking for any that match the addresses in her wallets. A few seconds after Joe’s wallet transmits the transaction, Alice’s wallet will indicate that it is receiving 0.10 BTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confirmations\n",
    "At first, Alice’s address will show the transaction from Joe as \"Unconfirmed.\" This means that the transaction has been propagated to the network but has not yet been recorded in the bitcoin transaction ledger, known as the blockchain. **To be confirmed, a transaction must be included in a block and added to the blockchain, which happens every 10 minutes, on average. In traditional financial terms this is known as clearing.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is now the proud owner of 0.10 BTC that she can spend. Next, we will look at her first purchase with bitcoin, and examine the underlying transaction and propagation technologies in more detail.\n",

    "In the overview diagram shown below, we see that the bitcoin system consists of users with wallets containing keys, transactions that are propagated across the network, and miners who produce (through competitive computation) the consensus blockchain, which is the authoritative ledger of all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BitcoinOverview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in this section is based on an actual transaction made on the bitcoin network, simulating the interactions between the users (Joe, Alice, Bob, and Gopesh) by sending funds from one wallet to another. While tracking a transaction through the bitcoin network to the blockchain, we will use a blockchain explorer site to visualize each step. **A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as a bitcoin search engine, in that it allows you to search for addresses, transactions, and blocks and see the relationships and flows between them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular blockchain explorers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BlockCypher Explorer](https://live.blockcypher.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [blockchain.info](https://www.blockchain.com/en/explorer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BitPay Insight](https://insight.bitpay.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these has a search function that can take a bitcoin address, transaction hash, block number, or block hash and retrieve corresponding information from the bitcoin network. With each transaction or block example, we will be having a URL so we can look it up and study it in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buying a Cup of Coffee\n",
    "Alice, introduced in the previous segment, is a new user who has just acquired her first bitcoin. In [Getting Your First Bitcoin](#Getting-Your-First-Bitcoin), Alice met with her friend Joe to exchange some cash for bitcoin. The transaction created by Joe funded Alice’s wallet with 0.10 BTC. Now Alice will make her first retail transaction, buying a cup of coffee at Bob’s coffee shop in Palo Alto, California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s Cafe recently started accepting bitcoin payments by adding a bitcoin option to its point-of-sale system. The prices at Bob’s Cafe are listed in the local currency (US dollars), but at the register, customers have the option of paying in either dollars or bitcoin. Alice places her order for a cup of coffee and Bob enters it into the register, as he does for all transactions. The point-of-sale system automatically converts the total price from US dollars to bitcoin at the prevailing market rate and displays the price in both currencies: Total: 1.50 USD / 0.015 BTC. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob’s point-of-sale system will also automatically create a special QR code containing a payment request referred to as **Payment Request QR Code**. Unlike a QR code that simply contains a destination bitcoin address, **a payment request is a QR-encoded URL that contains a destination address, a payment amount, and a generic description such as \"Bob’s Cafe\"**. This allows a bitcoin wallet application to prefill the information used to send the payment while showing a human-readable description to the user. You can scan the QR code with a bitcoin wallet application to see what Alice would see.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PaymentQREncodingURL.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice uses her smartphone to scan the barcode on display. Her smartphone shows a payment of 0.0150 BTC to Bob's Cafe and she selects Send to authorize the payment. Within a few seconds (about the same amount of time as a credit card authorization), Bob sees the transaction on the register, completing the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can examine Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe on the blockchain using a block explorer site ([View Alice’s transaction on blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/tx/0627052b6f28912f2703066a912ea577f2ce4da4caa5a5fbd8a57286c345c2f2))\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will examine this transaction in more detail. We’ll see how Alice’s wallet constructed it, how it was propagated across the network, how it was verified, and finally, how Bob can spend that amount in subsequent transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The bitcoin network can transact in fractional values, e.g., from millibitcoin (1/1000th of a bitcoin) down to 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin, which is known as a satoshi. Throughout this notebook, we’ll use the term “bitcoin” to refer to any quantity of bitcoin currency, from the smallest unit (1 satoshi) to the total number (21,000,000) of all bitcoin that will ever be mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, **a transaction tells the network that the owner of some bitcoin value has authorized the transfer of that value to another owner**. The new owner can now spend the bitcoin by creating another transaction that authorizes the transfer to another owner, and so on, in a chain of ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are like lines in a double-entry bookkeeping ledger. Each transaction contains one or more \"inputs,\" which are like debits against a bitcoin account. On the other side of the transaction, there are one or more \"outputs,\" which are like credits added to a bitcoin account. **The inputs and outputs (debits and credits) do not necessarily add up to the same amount. Instead, outputs add up to slightly less than inputs and the difference represents an implied transaction fee, which is a small payment collected by the miner who includes the transaction in the ledger**. A bitcoin transaction is shown as a bookkeeping ledger entry below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransacsAsDouble-Entry.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The transaction also contains proof of ownership for each amount of bitcoin (inputs) whose value is being spent, in the form of a digital signature from the owner, which can be independently validated by anyone.** In bitcoin terms, \"spending\" is signing a transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction over to a new owner identified by a bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s payment to Bob’s Cafe uses a previous transaction’s output as its input. In the previous section, Alice received bitcoin from her friend Joe in return for cash. That transaction created a bitcoin value locked by Alice’s key. Her new transaction to Bob’s Cafe references the previous transaction as an input and creates new outputs to pay for the cup of coffee and receive change. **The transactions form a chain, where the inputs from the latest transaction correspond to outputs from previous transactions. Alice’s key provides the signature that unlocks those previous transaction outputs, thereby proving to the bitcoin network that she owns the funds**. She attaches the payment for coffee to Bob’s address, thereby \"encumbering\" that output with the requirement that Bob produces a signature in order to spend that amount. This represents a transfer of value between Alice and Bob. This chain of transactions, from Joe to Alice to Bob, is illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransactionChain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Many bitcoin transactions will include outputs that reference both an address of the new owner and an address of the current owner, called the change address. This is because transaction inputs, like currency notes, cannot be divided. If you purchase a $\\$$5 US dollar item in a store but use a $\\$$ 20 US dollar bill to pay for the item, you expect to receive $\\$$15 US dollars in change. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to bitcoin transaction inputs. **If you purchased an item that costs 5 bitcoin but only had a 20 bitcoin input to use, you would send one output of 5 bitcoin to the store owner and one output of 15 bitcoin back to yourself as change (minus any applicable transaction fee)**. Importantly, the change address does not have to be the same address as that of the input and for privacy reasons is often a new address from the owner’s wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different wallets may use different strategies when aggregating inputs to make a payment requested by the user. They might aggregate many small inputs, or use one that is equal to or larger than the desired payment. **Unless the wallet can aggregate inputs in such a way to exactly match the desired payment plus transaction fees, the wallet will need to generate some change**. This is very similar to how people handle cash. If you always use the largest bill/note in your pocket, you will end up with a pocket full of loose change. If you only use the loose change, you’ll always have only big bills. People subconsciously find a balance between these two extremes, and bitcoin wallet developers strive to program this balance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In summary, **transactions move value from transaction inputs to transaction outputs**. An input is a reference to a previous transaction’s output, showing where the value is coming from. A transaction output directs a specific value to a new owner’s bitcoin address and can include a change output back to the original owner. Outputs from one transaction can be used as inputs in a new transaction, thus creating a chain of ownership as the value is moved from owner to owner\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Transaction Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "From 1: Common Transaction:<br>The most common form of transaction is a simple payment from one address to another, which often includes some \"change\" returned to the original owner. This type of transaction has one input and two outputs as shown below:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/CommonTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "From 2: Aggregating Transaction:<br>Another common form of transaction is one that aggregates several inputs into a single output. This represents the real-world equivalent of using a pile of coins and currency notes for paying a large value. Transactions like these are sometimes generated by wallet applications to clean up lots of smaller amounts that were received as change for payments.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AggregatingTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "From 3: Distributing Transaction:<br>\n",
    "Finally, another transaction form that is seen often on the bitcoin ledger is a transaction that distributes one input to multiple outputs representing multiple recipients. This type of transaction is sometimes used by commercial entities to distribute funds, such as when processing payroll payments to multiple employees.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/DistributingTransaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing a Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s wallet application contains all the logic for selecting appropriate inputs and outputs to build a transaction to Alice’s specification. Alice only needs to specify a destination and an amount, and the rest happens in the wallet application without her seeing the details. Importantly, a wallet application can construct transactions even if it is completely offline. Like writing a check at home and later sending it to the bank in an envelope, the transaction does not need to be constructed and signed while connected to the bitcoin network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Right Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s wallet application will first have to find inputs that can pay the amount she wants to send to Bob. Most wallets keep track of all the available outputs belonging to addresses in the wallet. Therefore, Alice’s wallet would contain a copy of the transaction output from Joe’s transaction, which was created in exchange for cash. A bitcoin wallet application that runs as a full-node client actually contains a copy of every unspent output from every transaction in the blockchain. This allows a wallet to construct transaction inputs as well as quickly verify incoming transactions as having correct inputs. However, because a full-node client takes up a lot of disk space, most user wallets run \"lightweight\" clients that track only the user’s own unspent outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the wallet application does not maintain a copy of unspent transaction outputs, it can query the bitcoin network to retrieve this information using a variety of APIs available by different providers or by asking a full-node using an application programming interface (API) call. The image below shows an API request, constructed as an HTTP GET command to a specific URL. This URL will return all the unspent transaction outputs for an address, giving any application the information it needs to construct transaction inputs for spending. We use the simple command-line HTTP client cURL to retrieve the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/UnspentAPIRequest.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The response shows one unspent output (one that has not been redeemed yet) under the ownership of Alice’s address 1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK. The response includes the reference to the transaction in which this unspent output is contained (the payment from Joe) and its value in satoshis, at 10 million, equivalent to 0.10 bitcoin. With this information, Alice’s wallet application can construct a transaction to transfer that value to new owner addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Alice’s wallet contains enough bitcoin in a single unspent output to pay for the cup of coffee. Had this not been the case, Alice’s wallet application might have to search through a pile of smaller unspent outputs, like picking coins from a purse until it could find enough to pay for the coffee. In both cases, there might be a need to get some change back, which we'll see in the next section, as the wallet application creates the transaction outputs (payments).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction output is created in the form of a script that creates an encumbrance on the value and can only be redeemed by the introduction of a solution to the script. In simpler terms, **Alice’s transaction output will contain a script that says something like, \"This output is payable to whoever can present a signature from the key corresponding to Bob’s public address.\" Because only Bob has the wallet with the keys corresponding to that address, only Bob’s wallet can present such a signature to redeem this output**. Alice will therefore \"encumber\" the output value with a demand for a signature from Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transaction will also include a second output, because Alice’s funds are in the form of a 0.10 BTC output, too much money for the 0.015 BTC cup of coffee. Alice will need 0.085 BTC in change. Alice’s change payment is created by Alice’s wallet as an output in the very same transaction as the payment to Bob. Essentially, Alice’s wallet breaks her funds into two payments: one to Bob and one back to herself. She can then use (spend) the change output in a subsequent transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the transaction to be processed by the network in a timely fashion, Alice’s wallet application will add a small fee. This is not explicit in the transaction; it is implied by the difference between inputs and outputs. If instead of taking 0.085 in change, Alice creates only 0.0845 as the second output, there will be 0.0005 BTC (half a millibitcoin) left over. The input’s 0.10 BTC is not fully spent with the two outputs, because they will add up to less than 0.10. The resulting difference is the transaction fee that is collected by the miner as a fee for validating and including the transaction in a block to be recorded on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting transaction can be seen using a blockchain explorer web application, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AliceTransac2Bob.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the Transaction to the Ledger\n",
    "**The transaction created by Alice’s wallet application is 258 bytes long and contains everything necessary to confirm ownership of the funds and assign new owners**. Now, the transaction must be transmitted to the bitcoin network where it will become part of the blockchain. In the next section we will see how a transaction becomes part of a new block and how the block is \"mined.\" Finally, we will see how the new block, once added to the blockchain, is increasingly trusted by the network as more blocks are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transmitting the transaction\n",
    "Because the transaction contains all the information necessary to process, it does not matter how or where it is transmitted to the bitcoin network. The bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer network, with each bitcoin client participating by connecting to several other bitcoin clients. The purpose of the bitcoin network is to propagate transactions and blocks to all participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it propagates\n",
    "**Any system, such as a server, desktop application, or wallet, that participates in the bitcoin network by \"speaking\" the bitcoin protocol is called a bitcoin node**. Alice’s wallet application can send the new transaction to any bitcoin node it is connected to over any type of connection: wired, WiFi, mobile, etc. Her bitcoin wallet does not have to be connected to Bob’s bitcoin wallet directly and she does not have to use the internet connection offered by the cafe, though both those options are possible, too. **Any bitcoin node that receives a valid transaction it has not seen before will immediately forward it to all other nodes to which it is connected, a propagation technique known as flooding**. Thus, the transaction rapidly propagates out across the peer-to-peer network, reaching a large percentage of the nodes within a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bob’s view**\n",
    "\n",
    "If Bob’s bitcoin wallet application is directly connected to Alice’s wallet application, Bob’s wallet application might be the first node to receive the transaction. However, even if Alice’s wallet sends the transaction through other nodes, it will reach Bob’s wallet within a few seconds.<br> **Bob’s wallet will immediately identify Alice’s transaction as an incoming payment because it contains outputs redeemable by Bob’s keys. Bob’s wallet application can also independently verify that the transaction is well formed, uses previously unspent inputs, and contains sufficient transaction fees to be included in the next block**. At this point Bob can assume, with little risk, that the transaction will shortly be included in a block and confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A common misconception about bitcoin transactions is that they must be \"confirmed\" by waiting 10 minutes for a new block, or up to 60 minutes for a full six confirmations. Although confirmations ensure the transaction has been accepted by the whole network, such a delay is unnecessary for small-value items such as a cup of coffee. A merchant may accept a valid small-value transaction with no confirmations, with no more risk than a credit card payment made without an ID or a signature, as merchants routinely accept today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitcoin Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s transaction is now propagated on the bitcoin network. It does not become part of the blockchain until it is verified and included in a block by a process called mining. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The bitcoin system of trust is based on computation. Transactions are bundled into blocks, which require an enormous amount of computation to prove, but only a small amount of computation to verify as proven**. The mining process serves two purposes in bitcoin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mining nodes validate all transactions by reference to bitcoin’s consensus rules. Therefore, mining provides security for bitcoin transactions by rejecting invalid or malformed transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mining creates new bitcoin in each block, almost like a central bank printing new money. The amount of bitcoin created per block is limited and diminishes with time, following a fixed issuance schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mining achieves a fine balance between cost and reward. Mining uses electricity to solve a mathematical problem. A successful miner will collect a reward in the form of new bitcoin and transaction fees. However, the reward will only be collected if the miner has correctly validated all the transactions, to the satisfaction of the rules of consensus. This delicate balance provides security for bitcoin without a central authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mining: An Analogical Explanation**<br>\n",
    "A good way to describe mining is like a giant competitive game of sudoku that resets every time someone finds a solution and whose difficulty automatically adjusts so that it takes approximately 10 minutes to find a solution. Imagine a giant sudoku puzzle, several thousand rows and columns in size. If I show you a completed puzzle you can verify it quite quickly. However, if the puzzle has a few squares filled and the rest are empty, it takes a lot of work to solve! The difficulty of the sudoku can be adjusted by changing its size (more or fewer rows and columns), but it can still be verified quite easily even if it is very large. **The \"puzzle\" used in bitcoin is based on a cryptographic hash and exhibits similar characteristics: it is asymmetrically hard to solve but easy to verify, and its difficulty can be adjusted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories), we introduced Jing, an entrepreneur in Shanghai. Jing runs a mining farm, which is a business that runs thousands of specialized mining computers, competing for the reward. Every 10 minutes or so, Jing’s mining computers compete against thousands of similar systems in a global race to find a solution to a block of transactions. **Finding such a solution, the so-called Proof-of-Work (PoW), requires quadrillions of hashing operations per second across the entire bitcoin network. The algorithm for Proof-of-Work involves repeatedly hashing the header of the block and a random number with the SHA256 cryptographic algorithm until a solution matching a predetermined pattern emerges**. The first miner to find such a solution wins the round of competition and publishes that block into the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jing started mining in 2010 using a very fast desktop computer to find a suitable Proof-of-Work for new blocks. As more miners started joining the bitcoin network, the difficulty of the problem increased rapidly. Soon, Jing and other miners upgraded to more specialized hardware, such as high-end dedicated graphical processing units (GPUs) cards such as those used in gaming desktops or consoles. At the time of this writing, the difficulty is so high that it is profitable only to mine with application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), essentially hundreds of mining algorithms printed in hardware, running in parallel on a single silicon chip. Jing’s company also participates in a mining pool, which much like a lottery pool allows several participants to share their efforts and rewards. Jing’s company now runs a warehouse containing thousands of ASIC miners to mine for bitcoin 24 hours a day. The company pays its electricity costs by selling the bitcoin it is able to generate from mining, creating some income from the profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mining Transactions in Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "New transactions are constantly flowing into the network from user wallets and other applications. As these are seen by the bitcoin network nodes, they get added to a temporary pool of unverified transactions maintained by each node. **As miners construct a new block, they add unverified transactions from this pool to the new block and then attempt to prove the validity of that new block, with the mining algorithm (Proof-of-Work).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are added to the new block, prioritized by the highest-fee transactions first and a few other criteria. <br>**Each miner starts the process of mining a new block of transactions as soon as he receives the previous block from the network, knowing he has lost that previous round of competition. He immediately creates a new block, fills it with transactions and the fingerprint of the previous block, and starts calculating the Proof-of-Work for the new block. Each miner includes a special transaction in his block, one that pays his own bitcoin address the block reward (currently 12.5 newly created bitcoin) plus the sum of transaction fees from all the transactions included in the block. If he finds a solution that makes that block valid, he \"wins\" this reward because his successful block is added to the global blockchain and the reward transaction he included becomes spendable**.<br> Jing, who participates in a mining pool, has set up his software to create new blocks that assign the reward to a pool address. From there, a share of the reward is distributed to Jing and other miners in proportion to the amount of work they contributed in the last round.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s transaction was picked up by the network and included in the pool of unverified transactions. Once validated by the mining software it was included in a new block, called a candidate block, generated by Jing’s mining pool. All the miners participating in that mining pool immediately start computing Proof-of-Work for the candidate block. Approximately five minutes after the transaction was first transmitted by Alice’s wallet, one of Jing’s ASIC miners found a solution for the candidate block and announced it to the network. Once other miners validated the winning block they started the race to generate the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the block that includes [Alice's Transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/block-height/277316)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jing’s winning block became part of the blockchain as block #277316, containing 419 transactions, including Alice’s transaction. **The block containing Alice’s transaction is counted as one \"confirmation\" of that transaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 19 minutes later, a new block, #277317, is mined by another miner. Because this new block is built on top of block #277316 that contained Alice’s transaction, it added even more computation to the blockchain, thereby strengthening the trust in those transactions. **Each block mined on top of the one containing the transaction counts as an additional confirmation for Alice’s transaction. As the blocks pile on top of each other, it becomes exponentially harder to reverse the transaction, thereby making it more and more trusted by the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AlicesTransacInBlock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram we can see block #277316, which contains Alice’s transaction. Below it are 277,316 blocks (including block #0), linked to each other in a chain of blocks (blockchain) all the way back to block #0, known as the **genesis block**. Over time, **as the \"height\" in blocks increases, so does the computation difficulty for each block and the chain as a whole**. The blocks mined after the one that contains Alice’s transaction act as further assurance, as they pile on more computation in a longer and longer chain. **By convention, any block with more than six confirmations is considered irrevocable, because it would require an immense amount of computation to invalidate and recalculate six blocks**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pool Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooled mining is a mining approach where multiple generating clients contribute to the generation of a block, and then split the block reward according the contributed processing power. Pooled mining effectively reduces the granularity of the block generation reward, spreading it out more smoothly over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mining pool coordinates the workers. Think of it like a lottery. If you and your friends all buy tickets in the lottery the group has a better chance of winning i.e. **pool mining elevates the probability of successful generation of a block**. To be fair in the lottery example everyone should be rewarded proportional to the amount of money spent on tickets. So if there are 20 tickets for the pool one person purchased 10 and two people purchased 5 each - if one of the 20 tickets win the person who purchased 10 gets 50% and the other two get 25% each.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a mining pool does is function as a coordinator for all the pool participants doing:\n",
    "- Taking the pool members hashes\n",
    "- Looking for block rewards\n",
    "- Recording how much work all the participants are doing\n",
    "- Assigning block rewards proportionally to participants contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Miners mine differently by running pool software instead of the bitcoin client and just performing hashes for the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spending the Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that Alice’s transaction has been embedded in the blockchain as part of a block, it is part of the distributed ledger of bitcoin and visible to all bitcoin applications. Each bitcoin client can independently verify the transaction as valid and spendable.<br> **Full-node clients can track the source of the funds from the moment a given bitcoin(s) was first generated in a block, incrementally from transaction to transaction, until they reach Bob’s address. Lightweight clients can do what is called a simplified payment verification by confirming that the transaction is in the blockchain and has several blocks mined after it, thus providing assurance that the miners accepted it as valid**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob can now spend the output from this and other transactions. For example, Bob can pay a contractor or supplier by transferring value from Alice’s coffee cup payment to these new owners. Most likely, Bob’s bitcoin software will aggregate many small payments into a larger payment, perhaps concentrating all the day’s bitcoin revenue into a single transaction. This would aggregate the various payments into a single output (and a single address).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Bob spends the payments received from Alice and other customers, he extends the chain of transactions. Let’s assume that Bob pays his web designer Gopesh in Bangalore for a new website page. Now the chain of transactions will look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ABG-TransactionChain.png)\n",
    "Note: The Inputs and Outputs don't have the names of the entities participating in transactions, rather the inputs and outputs fields contains the addresses to the bitcoin wallets of the senders and the receivers respectively (notice that the addresses aren't linked to sender's and receiver's identity, therefore, provides anonymity).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To this moment, we saw how transactions build a chain that moves value from owner to owner. We also tracked Alice’s transaction, from the moment it was created in her wallet, through the bitcoin network and to the miners who recorded it on the blockchain. In the rest of this notebook, we will examine the specific technologies behind wallets, addresses, signatures, transactions, the network, and finally mining.\n",

Cryptography can also be used to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing that secret (digital signature), or prove the authenticity of data (digital fingerprint). These types of cryptographic proofs are the mathematical tools critical to bitcoin and used extensively in bitcoin applications. **Ironically, encryption is not an important part of bitcoin, as its communications and transaction data are not encrypted and do not need to be encrypted to protect the funds.** In this section we will introduce some of the cryptography used in bitcoin to control ownership of funds, in the form of keys, addresses, and wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ownership of bitcoin is established through digital keys, bitcoin addresses, and digital signatures**. The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but are instead created and stored by users in a file, or simple database, called a wallet. **The digital keys in a user’s wallet are completely independent of the bitcoin protocol and can be generated and managed by the user’s wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the internet**. Keys enable many of the interesting properties of bitcoin, including decentralized trust and control, ownership attestation, and the cryptographic-proof security model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Most bitcoin transactions require a valid digital signature to be included in the blockchain, which can only be generated with a secret key; therefore, anyone with a copy of that key has control of the bitcoin. The digital signature used to spend funds is also referred to as a witness, a term used in cryptography. The witness data in a bitcoin transaction serves as an evidence of the true ownership of the funds being spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key**. Think of the public key as similar to a bank account number and the private key as similar to the secret PIN, or signature on a check, that provides control over the account. These digital keys are very rarely seen by the users of bitcoin. For the most part, they are stored inside the wallet file and managed by the bitcoin wallet software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the payment portion of a bitcoin transaction, **the recipient’s public key is represented by its digital fingerprint, called a bitcoin address**, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary name on a check (i.e., \"Pay to the order of\"). **In most cases, a bitcoin address is generated from and corresponds to a public key**. However, not all bitcoin addresses represent public keys; they can also represent other beneficiaries such as scripts, as we will see later in this section. This way, bitcoin addresses abstract the recipient of funds, making transaction destinations flexible, similar to paper checks: a single payment instrument that can be used to pay into people’s accounts, pay into company accounts, pay for bills, or pay to cash. The bitcoin address is the only representation of the keys that users will routinely see, because this is the part they need to share with the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will introduce cryptography and explain the mathematics used in bitcoin. Next, we will look at how keys are generated, stored, and managed. We will review the various encoding formats used to represent private and public keys, addresses, and script addresses. Finally, we will look at advanced use of keys and addresses: vanity, multisignature, and script addresses and paper wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Key Cryptography and Cryptocurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key cryptography was invented in the 1970s and is a mathematical foundation for computer and information security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the invention of public key cryptography, several suitable mathematical functions, such as prime number exponentiation and elliptic curve multiplication, have been discovered. **These mathematical functions are practically irreversible, meaning that they are easy to calculate in one direction and infeasible to calculate in the opposite direction (One-way Functions)**. Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures. **Bitcoin uses elliptic curve multiplication as the basis for its cryptography**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In bitcoin, we use public key cryptography to create a key pair that controls access to bitcoin. The key pair consists of a private key and—​derived from it—​a unique public key. **The public key is used to receive funds, and the private key is used to sign transactions to spend the funds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a mathematical relationship between the public and the private key that allows the private key to be used to generate signatures on messages. This signature can be validated against the public key without revealing the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When spending bitcoin, the current bitcoin owner presents her public key and a signature (different each time, but created from the same private key) in a transaction to spend those bitcoin**. Through the presentation of the public key and signature, everyone in the bitcoin network can verify and accept the transaction as valid, confirming that the person transferring the bitcoin owned them at the time of the transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In most wallet implementations, the private and public keys are stored together as a key pair for convenience. However, the public key can be calculated from the private key, so storing only the private key is also possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private and Public Keys\n",
    "A bitcoin wallet contains a collection of key pairs, each consisting of a private key and a public key. \n",
    "- The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at random. \n",
    "- From the private key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a public key (K).\n",
    "- From the public key (K), we use a one-way cryptographic hash function to generate a bitcoin address (A). That's why a bitcoin address is some times referred to as a digital fingerprint of the public key. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will start with generating the private key, look at the elliptic curve math that is used to turn that into a public key, and finally, generate a bitcoin address from the public key. The relationship between private key, public key, and bitcoin address is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PrivPubAddress.png)<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Asymmetric Cryptography (Public/Private Keys)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is asymmetric cryptography used in bitcoin? It’s not used to \"encrypt\" (make secret) the transactions. Rather, the useful property of asymmetric cryptography is the ability to generate digital signatures. **A private key can be applied to the digital fingerprint of a transaction to produce a numerical signature. This signature can only be produced by someone with knowledge of the private key. However, anyone with access to the public key and the transaction fingerprint can use them to verify the signature**. This useful property of asymmetric cryptography makes it possible for anyone to verify every signature on every transaction, while ensuring that only the owners of private keys can produce valid signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "A private key is simply a number, picked at random. Ownership and control over the private key is the root of user control over all funds associated with the corresponding bitcoin address. The private key is used to create signatures that are required to spend bitcoin by proving ownership of funds used in a transaction. **The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the bitcoin secured by that key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss, because if it’s lost it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are forever lost, too.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The bitcoin private key is just a number. You can pick your private keys randomly using just a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256 times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you can use in a bitcoin wallet. The public key can then be generated from the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a private key from a random number\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness**. Creating a bitcoin key is essentially the same as \"Pick a number between 1 and $2^{256}$.\" The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or repeatable. **Bitcoin software uses the underlying operating system’s random number generators to produce 256 bits of entropy (randomness)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds in order to generate enough entropy/randomness, for example, check this super useful web-based tool [Bit Address](http://bitaddress.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the private key can be any number between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, where n is a constant (n = 1.1578 * 1077, slightly less than $2^{256}$) defined as the order of the elliptic curve used in bitcoin (see Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained). To create such a key, we randomly pick a 256-bit number and check that it is less than n. **In programming terms, this is usually achieved by feeding a larger string of random bits, collected from a cryptographically secure source of randomness, into the SHA-256 hash algorithm, which will conveniently produce a 256-bit number.** If the result is less than n, we have a suitable private key. Otherwise, we simply try again with another random number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: \n",
    ">Do not write your own code to create a random number or use a \"simple\" random number generator offered by your programming language. **Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) with a seed from a source of sufficient entropy**. Study the documentation of the random number generator library you choose to make sure it is cryptographically secure. **Correct implementation of the CSPRNG is critical to the security of the keys.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "The public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication, which is irreversible: K = k * G, where k is the private key, G is a constant point called the generator point, and K is the resulting public key. The reverse operation, known as \"finding the discrete logarithm\"—calculating k if you know K—is as difficult as trying all possible values of k, i.e., a brute-force search. Before we demonstrate how to generate a public key from a private key, let’s look at elliptic curve cryptography in a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Elliptic curve multiplication is a type of function that cryptographers call a \"trap door\" function: it is easy to do in one direction (multiplication) and impossible to do in the reverse direction (division). The owner of the private key can easily create the public key and then share it with the world knowing that no one can reverse the function and calculate the private key from the public key. This mathematical trick becomes the basis for unforgeable and secure digital signatures that prove ownership of bitcoin funds.\n",

    "Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of asymmetric or public key cryptography based on the discrete logarithm problem as expressed by addition and multiplication on the points of an elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EllipticCurve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin uses a specific elliptic curve and set of mathematical constants, as defined in a standard called secp256k1, established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The secp256k1 curve is defined by the following function, which produces an elliptic curve:<br>\n",
    "$\\begin{equation} {y^2 = (x^3 + 7)}~\\text{over}~(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\end{equation}$ <br>\n",
    "or<br>\n",
    "$\\begin{equation} {y^2 \\mod p = (x^3 + 7) \\mod p} \\end{equation}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mod p (modulo prime number p) indicates that this curve is over a finite field of prime order p, also written as \n",
    "$\\mathbb{F}_p$, where p = $2^{256}$ – $2^{32}$ – $2^{9}$ – $2^8$ – $2^7$ – $2^6$ – $2^4$ – 1, a very large prime number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this curve is defined over a finite field of prime order instead of over the real numbers, it looks like a pattern of dots scattered in two dimensions, which makes it difficult to visualize. However, the math is identical to that of an elliptic curve over real numbers. As an example, visualizing an elliptic curve over F(p), with p=17 below shows the same elliptic curve over a much smaller finite field of prime order 17, showing a pattern of dots on a grid. The secp256k1 bitcoin elliptic curve can be thought of as a much more complex pattern of dots on a unfathomably large grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EllipticCurvep=17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, the following is a point P with coordinates (x,y) that is a point on the secp256k1 curve:<br>\n",
    "P = (55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240, 32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elliptic Curve Math** (Refer to the recommended watch first)\n",
    "\n",
    "In elliptic curve math, there is a point called the **\"point at infinity,\"** which roughly corresponds to the role of zero in addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a + operator, called \"addition,\" which has some properties similar to the traditional addition of real numbers that gradeschool children learn. Given two points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 + P2, also on the elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, this third point P3 is calculated by drawing a line between P1 and P2. This line will intersect the elliptic curve in exactly one additional place. Call this point P3' = (x, y). Then reflect in the x-axis to get P3 = (x, –y).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of special cases that explain the need for the \"point at infinity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If P1 and P2 are the same point, the line \"between\" P1 and P2 should extend to be the tangent on the curve at this point P1. This tangent will intersect the curve in exactly one new point. You can use techniques from calculus to determine the slope of the tangent line. These techniques curiously work, even though we are restricting our interest to points on the curve with two integer coordinates!\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases (i.e., if P1 and P2 have the same x values but different y values), the tangent line will be exactly vertical, in which case P3 = \"point at infinity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If P1 is the \"point at infinity,\" then P1 + P2 = P2. Similarly, if P2 is the point at infinity, then P1 + P2 = P1. This shows how the point at infinity plays the role of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that + is associative, which means that (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). That means we can write A + B + C without parentheses and without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined addition, we can define multiplication in the standard way that extends addition. For a point P on the elliptic curve, if k is a whole number, then kP = P + P + P + …​ + P (k times). Note that k is sometimes confusingly called an \"exponent\" in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a Public Key\n",
    "- Starting with a private key in the form of a randomly generated number k, we multiply it by a predetermined point on the curve called the generator point G to produce another point somewhere else on the curve, which is the corresponding public key K. \n",
    "- The generator point is specified as part of the secp256k1 standard and is always the same for all keys in bitcoin: $\\begin{equation} {K = k * G} \\end{equation}$ where k is the private key, G is the generator point, and K is the resulting public key, a point on the curve.\n",
    "- Because the generator point is always the same for all bitcoin users, a private key k multiplied with G will always result in the same public key K. The relationship between k and K is fixed, but can only be calculated in one direction (as it's hard to compute discrete log), from k to K. That’s why a bitcoin address (derived from K) can be shared with anyone and does not reveal the user’s private key (k).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A private key can be converted into a public key, but a public key cannot be converted back into a private key because the math only works one way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the elliptic curve multiplication, we take the private key k generated previously and multiply it with the generator point G to find the public key K:<br>\n",
    "`K = 1E99423A4ED27608A15A2616A2B0E9E52CED330AC530EDCC32C8FFC6A526AEDD * G`\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize multiplication of a point with an integer, we will use the simpler elliptic curve over real numbers—remember, the math is the same. Our goal is to find the multiple kG of the generator point G, which is the same as adding G to itself, k times in a row. In elliptic curves, adding a point to itself is the equivalent of drawing a tangent line on the point and finding where it intersects the curve again, then reflecting that point on the x-axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Bitcoin Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "A bitcoin address is a string of digits and characters that can be shared with anyone who wants to send you money. Addresses produced from public keys consist of a string of numbers and letters, beginning with the digit \"1.\" Here’s an example of a bitcoin address:`1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy`\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin address is what appears most commonly in a transaction as the \"recipient\" of the funds. If we compare a bitcoin transaction to a paper check, the bitcoin address is the beneficiary, which is what we write on the line after \"Pay to the order of.\" On a paper check, that beneficiary can sometimes be the name of a bank account holder, but can also include corporations, institutions, or even cash. Because paper checks do not need to specify an account, but rather use an abstract name as the recipient of funds, they are very flexible payment instruments. Bitcoin transactions use a similar abstraction, the bitcoin address, to make them very flexible. A bitcoin address can represent the owner of a private/public key pair, or it can represent something else, such as a payment script. For now, let’s examine the simple case, a bitcoin address that represents, and is derived from, a public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The bitcoin address is derived from the public key through the use of one-way cryptographic hashing. A \"hashing algorithm\" or simply \"hash algorithm\" is a one-way function that produces a fingerprint or \"hash\" of an arbitrary-sized input**. Cryptographic hash functions are used extensively in bitcoin: in bitcoin addresses, in script addresses, and in the mining Proof-of-Work algorithm. The algorithms used to make a bitcoin address from a public key are the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) and the RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD), specifically SHA256 and RIPEMD160.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the public key K, we compute the SHA256 hash and then compute the RIPEMD160 hash of the result, producing a 160-bit (20-byte) number:<br> `A = RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))` where K is the public key and A is the resulting bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A bitcoin address is not the same as a public key. Bitcoin addresses are derived from a public key using a one-way function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin addresses are almost always encoded as \"Base58Check\", which uses 58 characters (a Base58 number system) and a checksum to help human readability, avoid ambiguity, and protect against errors in address transcription and entry. Base58Check is also used in many other ways in bitcoin, whenever there is a need for a user to read and correctly transcribe a number, such as a bitcoin address, a private key, an encrypted key, or a script hash. Next, we will examine the mechanics of Base58Check encoding and decoding and the resulting representations. Following illustrates the conversion of a public key into a bitcoin address:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PubKey2Add.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base58 and Base58Check Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent long numbers in a compact way, using fewer symbols, many computer systems use mixed-alphanumeric representations with a base (or radix) higher than 10. For example, whereas the traditional decimal system uses the 10 numerals 0 through 9, the hexadecimal system uses 16, with the letters A through F as the six additional symbols. A number represented in hexadecimal format is shorter than the equivalent decimal representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even more compact, Base64 representation uses 26 lowercase letters, 26 capital letters, 10 numerals, and 2 more characters such as $\"&#x201d;$ and \"/\" to transmit binary data over text-based media such as email. Base64 is most commonly used to add binary attachments to email. **Base58 is a text-based binary-encoding format developed for use in bitcoin and used in many other cryptocurrencies. It offers a balance between compact representation, readability, and error detection and prevention. Base58 is a subset of Base64**, using upper and lowercase letters and numbers, but omitting some characters that are frequently mistaken for one another and can appear identical when displayed in certain fonts. Specifically, Base58 is Base64 without the 0 (number zero), O (capital o), l (lower L), I (capital i), and the symbols $&#x201c;``”$ and \"/\". Or, more simply, it is a set of lowercase and capital letters and numbers without the four (0, O, l, I) just mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin’s Base58 alphabets are as follows: `123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base58Check Encoding**: Added security using Checksum<br>\n",
    "To add extra security against typos or transcription errors, Base58Check is a Base58 encoding format, frequently used in bitcoin, which has a built-in error-checking code. The checksum is an additional four bytes added to the end of the data that is being encoded. **The checksum is derived from the hash of the encoded data and can therefore be used to detect and prevent transcription and typing errors. When presented with Base58Check code, the decoding software will calculate the checksum of the data and compare it to the checksum included in the code. If the two do not match, an error has been introduced and the Base58Check data is invalid**. This prevents a mistyped bitcoin address from being accepted by the wallet software as a valid destination, an error that would otherwise result in loss of funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bitcoin, most of the data presented to the user is Base58Check-encoded to make it compact, easy to read, and easy to detect errors. **The version prefix in Base58Check encoding, as you will see below, is used to create easily distinguishable formats, which when encoded in Base58 contain specific characters at the beginning of the Base58Check-encoded payload. These characters make it easy for humans to identify the type of data that is encoded and how to use it.** This is what differentiates, for example, a Base58Check-encoded bitcoin address that starts with a 1 from a Base58Check-encoded private key WIF that starts with a 5. Some example version prefixes and the resulting Base58 characters are shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Base58CheckEncoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first add a prefix to the data, called the \"version byte,\" which serves to easily identify the type of data that is encoded. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we compute the \"double-SHA\" checksum, meaning we apply the SHA256 hash-algorithm twice on the previous result (prefix and data), that is, `checksum = SHA256(SHA256(prefix+data))`. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the resulting 32-byte hash (hash-of-a-hash), we take only the first four bytes. These four bytes serve as the error-checking code, or checksum. The checksum is concatenated (appended) to the end.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The result is composed of three items: a prefix, the data, and a checksum. This result is encoded using the Base58 alphabet described previously. The image below illustrates the Base58Check encoding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Formats\n",
    "Both private and public keys can be represented in a number of different formats. These representations all encode the same number, even though they look different. **These formats are primarily used to make it easy for people to read and transcribe keys without introducing errors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private Key Formats**<br>\n",
    "The private key can be represented in a number of different formats, all of which correspond to the same 256-bit number. The image below shows three common formats used to represent private keys. Different formats are used in different circumstances. **Hexadecimal and raw binary formats are used internally in software and rarely shown to users. The WIF (Wallet Import Format) is used for import/export of keys between wallets and often used in QR code (barcode) representations of private keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PrivateKeyRepresentations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these representations are different ways of showing the same number, the same private key. They look different, but any one format can easily be converted to any other format. Note that the \"raw binary\" is not shown in Example: Same key, different formats as any encoding for display here would, by definition, not be raw binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public Key Formats**<br>\n",
    "Public keys are also presented in different ways, usually as **either compressed or uncompressed public keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw previously, the public key is a point on the elliptic curve consisting of a pair of coordinates (x,y). It is usually presented with the prefix 04 followed by two 256-bit numbers: one for the x coordinate of the point, the other for the y coordinate. **The prefix 04 is used to distinguish uncompressed public keys from compressed public keys that begin with a 02 or a 03**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Compressed Public Keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compressed public keys were introduced to bitcoin to reduce the size of transactions and conserve disk space on nodes that store the bitcoin blockchain database**. Most transactions include the public key, which is required to validate the owner’s credentials and spend the bitcoin. **Each public key requires 520 bits (prefix + x + y)**, which when multiplied by several hundred transactions per block, or tens of thousands of transactions per day, adds a significant amount of data to the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the section Public Keys, a public key is a point (x,y) on an elliptic curve. Because the curve expresses a mathematical function, a point on the curve represents a solution to the equation and, therefore, **if we know the x coordinate we can calculate the y coordinate by solving the equation y2 mod p = (x3 + 7) mod p. That allows us to store only the x coordinate of the public key point, omitting the y coordinate and reducing the size of the key and the space required to store it by 256 bits. An almost 50% reduction in size in every transaction adds up to a lot of data saved over time!**\n",

    "**Whereas uncompressed public keys have a prefix of 04, compressed public keys start with either a 02 or a 03 prefix**. Let’s look at why there are two possible prefixes: because the left side of the equation is y2, the solution for y is a square root, which can have a positive or negative value. Visually, this means that the resulting y coordinate can be above or below the x-axis. As you can see from the graph of the elliptic curve in An elliptic curve, the curve is symmetric, meaning it is reflected like a mirror by the x-axis. **So, while we can omit the y coordinate we have to store the sign of y (positive or negative); or in other words, we have to remember if it was above or below the x-axis because each of those options represents a different point and a different public key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PublicKeyCompression.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When calculating the elliptic curve in binary arithmetic on the finite field of prime order p, the y coordinate is either even or odd, which corresponds to the positive/negative sign**, that is, say if p = 17, then imagine if we solve the elliptic curve equation and end up having $y^2$ mod p = 4, that means, y could be either +2 or -2, where +2 mod p corresponds to 2(which is even), while -2 corresponds to 15 (17-2), which is odd.  Therefore, to distinguish between the two possible values of y, we store a compressed public key with the prefix **02 if the y is even (+y), and 03 if it is odd (-y)**, allowing the software to correctly deduce the y coordinate from the x coordinate and uncompress the public key to the full coordinates of the point. Public key compression is illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the same public key generated previously, shown as a compressed public key stored in 264 bits (66 hex digits) with the prefix 03 indicating the y coordinate is odd:\n",

    "`K = 03F028892BAD7ED57D2FB57BF33081D5CFCF6F9ED3D3D7F159C2E2FFF579DC341A`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Address Problem: Compressed Vs Uncompressed Public Key:**<br>\n",
    "This compressed public key corresponds to the same private key, meaning it is generated from the same private key. However, it looks different from the uncompressed public key. More importantly, if we convert this compressed public key to a bitcoin address using the double-hash function `RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))` it will produce a different bitcoin address. This can be confusing, because it means that a single private key can produce a public key expressed in two different formats (compressed and uncompressed) that produce two different bitcoin addresses. However, the private key is identical for both bitcoin addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compressed public keys are gradually becoming the default across bitcoin clients, which is having a significant impact on reducing the size of transactions and therefore the blockchain**. However, not all clients support compressed public keys yet. Newer clients that support compressed public keys have to account for transactions from older clients that do not support compressed public keys. This is especially important when a wallet application is importing private keys from another bitcoin wallet application, because the new wallet needs to scan the blockchain to find transactions corresponding to these imported keys. **Which bitcoin addresses should the bitcoin wallet scan for? The bitcoin addresses produced by uncompressed public keys, or the bitcoin addresses produced by compressed public keys? Both are valid bitcoin addresses, and can be signed for by the private key, but they are different addresses!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    ">**To resolve this issue, when private keys are exported from a wallet, the WIF that is used to represent them is implemented differently in newer bitcoin wallets, to indicate that these private keys have been used to produce compressed public keys and therefore compressed bitcoin addresses**. This allows the importing wallet to distinguish between private keys originating from older or newer wallets and search the blockchain for transactions with bitcoin addresses corresponding to the uncompressed, or the compressed, public keys, respectively. Let’s look at how this works in more detail, next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compressed private keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ironically, the term \"compressed private key\" is a misnomer**, because when a private key is exported as WIF-compressed it is actually one byte longer than an \"uncompressed\" private key. That is because the private key has an added one-byte suffix (shown as 01 in Hex-compressed in image below), which signifies that the private key is from a newer wallet and should only be used to produce compressed public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private keys are not themselves compressed and cannot be compressed. The term \"compressed private key\" really means \"private key from which only compressed public keys should be derived,\" whereas \"uncompressed private key\" really means \"private key from which only uncompressed public keys should be derived\".** You should only refer to the export format as \"WIF-compressed\" or \"WIF\" and not refer to the private key itself as \"compressed\" to avoid further confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PrivateKeyFormats.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the hex-compressed private key format has one extra byte at the end (01 in hex). While the Base58 encoding version prefix is the same (0x80) for both WIF and WIF-compressed formats, the addition of one byte on the end of the number causes the first character of the Base58 encoding to change from a 5 to either a K or L. Think of this as the Base58 equivalent of the decimal encoding difference between the number 100 and the number 99. While 100 is one digit longer than 99, it also has a prefix of 1 instead of a prefix of 9. As the length changes, it affects the prefix. In Base58, the prefix 5 changes to a K or L as the length of the number increases by one byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, these formats are not used interchangeably. In a newer wallet that implements compressed public keys, the private keys will only ever be exported as WIF-compressed (with a K or L prefix). If the wallet is an older implementation and does not use compressed public keys, the private keys will only ever be exported as WIF (with a 5 prefix). The goal here is to signal to the wallet importing these private keys whether it must search the blockchain for compressed or uncompressed public keys and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \"Compressed private keys\" is a misnomer! They are not compressed; rather, **WIF-compressed signifies that the keys should only be used to derive compressed public keys and their corresponding bitcoin addresses**. Ironically, a \"WIF-compressed\" encoded private key is one byte longer because it has the added 01 suffix to distinguish it from an \"uncompressed\" one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "> If a bitcoin wallet is able to implement compressed public keys, it will use those in all transactions. The private keys in the wallet will be used to derive the public key points on the curve, which will be compressed. The compressed public keys will be used to produce bitcoin addresses and those will be used in transactions. When exporting private keys from a new wallet that implements compressed public keys, the WIF is modified, with the addition of a one-byte suffix 01 to the private key. The resulting Base58Check-encoded private key is called a \"compressed WIF\" and starts with the letter K or L, instead of starting with \"5\" as is the case with WIF-encoded (noncompressed) keys from older wallets.\n",

    "### Advanced Keys and Addresses\n",
    "In the following sections we will look at advanced forms of keys and addresses, such as encrypted private keys, script and multisignature addresses, vanity addresses, and paper wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encrypted Private Keys (BIP-38)\n",
    "\n",
    "Private keys must remain secret. The need for confidentiality of the private keys is a truism that is quite difficult to achieve in practice, because it conflicts with the equally important security objective of availability. **Keeping the private key private is much harder when you need to store backups of the private key to avoid losing it**. A private key stored in a wallet that is encrypted by a password might be secure, but that wallet needs to be backed up. At times, users need to move keys from one wallet to another—to upgrade or replace the wallet software, for example.**Private key backups might also be stored on paper (see Paper Wallets) or on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive. But what if the backup itself is stolen or lost?** These conflicting security goals led to the introduction of a **portable and convenient standard for encrypting private keys in a way that can be understood by many different wallets and bitcoin clients, standardized by BIP-38.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal**. A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a design document for introducing features or information to Bitcoin. This is the standard way of communicating ideas since Bitcoin has no formal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-38 proposes a common standard for encrypting private keys with a passphrase and encoding them with Base58Check** so that they can be stored securely on backup media, transported securely between wallets, or kept in any other conditions where the key might be exposed. **The standard for encryption uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**, a standard established by the NIST and used broadly in data encryption implementations for commercial and military applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-38 Encryption Scheme**:<br>\n",
    "- It takes as input a bitcoin private key, usually encoded in the WIF, as a Base58Check string with the prefix of \"5\".\n",
    "- Additionally, the BIP-38 encryption scheme takes a passphrase—a long password—usually composed of several words or a complex string of alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "- The result of the BIP-38 encryption scheme is a **Base58Check-encoded encrypted private key that begins with the prefix 6P**. If you see a key that starts with 6P, it is encrypted and requires a passphrase in order to convert (decrypt) it back into a WIF-formatted private key (prefix 5) that can be used in any wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many wallet applications now recognize BIP-38-encrypted private keys and will prompt the user for a passphrase to decrypt and import the key. Third-party applications, such as the incredibly useful browser-based [Bit Address](http://bitaddress.org/) (Wallet Details tab), can be used to decrypt BIP-38 keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use case for BIP-38 encrypted keys is for paper wallets that can be used to back up private keys on a piece of paper. As long as the user selects a strong passphrase, a paper wallet with BIP-38 encrypted private keys is incredibly secure and a great way to create offline bitcoin storage (also known as \"cold storage\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the encrypted keys in given below using [Bit Address](http://bitaddress.org/)(Wallet details tab) to see how you can get the decrypted key by entering the passphrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/BIP-38EncryptedPrivKeyEx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pay-to-Script Hash (P2SH) and Multisig Addresses\n",
    "As we know, traditional bitcoin addresses begin with the number “1” and are derived from the public key, which is derived from the private key. Although anyone can send bitcoin to a “1” address, that bitcoin can only be spent by presenting the corresponding private key signature and public key hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin addresses that begin with the number “3” are pay-to-script hash (P2SH) addresses, sometimes erroneously called multisignature or multisig addresses. They designate the beneficiary of a bitcoin transaction as the hash of a script, instead of the owner of a public key**. The feature was introduced in January 2012 with **BIP-16**, and is being **widely adopted because it provides the opportunity to add functionality to the address itself**. Unlike transactions that \"send\" funds to traditional “1” bitcoin addresses, also known as a pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH), **funds sent to “3” addresses require something more than the presentation of one public key hash and one private key signature as proof of ownership. The requirements are designated at the time the address is created, within the script, and all inputs to this address will be encumbered with the same requirements.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A P2SH address is created from a transaction script, which defines who can spend a transaction output. Encoding a P2SH address involves using the same double-hash function as used during creation of a bitcoin address, only applied on the script instead of the public key:<br> `script hash = RIPEMD160(SHA256(script))` <br>\n",
    "The resulting \"script hash\" is encoded with Base58Check with a version prefix of 5, which results in an encoded address starting with a 3. An example of a P2SH address is `3F6i6kwkevjR7AsAd4te2YB2zZyASEm1HM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **P2SH is not necessarily the same as a multisignature standard transaction**. A P2SH address most often represents a multi-signature script, but it might also represent a script encoding other types of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multisignature addresses and P2SH\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the most common implementation of the P2SH function is the multi-signature address script. As the name implies, the underlying script requires more than one signature to prove ownership and therefore spend funds. **The bitcoin multi-signature feature is designed to require M signatures (also known as the “threshold”) from a total of N keys, known as an M-of-N multisig, where M is equal to or less than N**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: Bob the coffee shop owner could use a multisignature address requiring 1-of-2 signatures from a key belonging to him and a key belonging to his spouse, ensuring either of them could sign to spend a transaction output locked to this address. This would be similar to a “joint account” as implemented in traditional banking where either spouse can spend with a single signature. Or Gopesh, the web designer paid by Bob to create a website, might have a 2-of-3 multisignature address for his business that ensures that no funds can be spent unless at least two of the business partners sign a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore how to create transactions that spend funds from P2SH (and multi-signature) addresses in the upcoming Transactions section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vanity Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanity addresses are valid bitcoin addresses that contain human-readable messages. For example, `1LoveBPzzD72PUXLzCkYAtGFYmK5vYNR33` is a valid address that contains the letters forming the word \"Love\" as the first four Base-58 letters. Vanity addresses require generating and testing billions of candidate private keys, until a bitcoin address with the desired pattern is found. Although there are some optimizations in the vanity generation algorithm, **the process essentially involves picking a private key at random, deriving the public key, deriving the bitcoin address, and checking to see if it matches the desired vanity pattern, repeating billions of times until a match is found**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a vanity address matching the desired pattern is found, the private key from which it was derived can be used by the owner to spend bitcoin in exactly the same way as any other address. Vanity addresses are no less or more secure than any other address. They depend on the same Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and SHA as any other address. You can no more easily find the private key of an address starting with a vanity pattern than you can any other address.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories), we introduced Eugenia, a children’s charity director operating in the Philippines. Let’s say that Eugenia is organizing a bitcoin fundraising drive and wants to use a vanity bitcoin address to publicize the fundraising. Eugenia will create a vanity address that starts with \"1Kids\" to promote the children’s charity fundraiser. Let’s see how this vanity address will be created and what it means for the security of Eugenia’s charity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generating vanity addresses**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to realize that a bitcoin address is simply a number represented by symbols in the Base58 alphabet. The search for a pattern like \"1Kids\" can be seen as searching for an address in the range from 1Kids11111111111111111111111111111 to 1Kidszzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. There are approximately $58^{29}$ (approximately 1.4 * $10^{51}$) addresses in that range, all starting with \"1Kids.\" The range of vanity addresses starting with \"1Kids\" shows the range of addresses that have the prefix 1Kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the pattern \"1Kids\" as a number and see how frequently we might find this pattern in a bitcoin address. An average desktop computer PC, without any specialized hardware, can search approximately 100,000 keys per second.\n",
    "![](./Images/FrequencyOfVanityPattern.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Eugenia won’t be creating the vanity address \"1KidsCharity\" anytime soon, even if she had access to several thousand computers. Each additional character increases the difficulty by a factor of 58. Patterns with more than seven characters are usually found by specialized hardware, such as custom-built desktops with multiple GPUs. These are often repurposed bitcoin mining \"rigs\" that are no longer profitable for bitcoin mining but can be used to find vanity addresses. Vanity searches on GPU systems are many orders of magnitude faster than on a general-purpose CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another way to find a vanity address is to outsource the work to a pool of vanity miners**, such as the pool at [Vanity Pool](http://vanitypool.appspot.com/). A pool is a service that allows those with GPU hardware to earn bitcoin searching for vanity addresses for others. For a small payment (0.01 bitcoin or approximately 5 USD at the time of this writing), Eugenia can outsource the search for a seven-character pattern vanity address and get results in a few hours instead of having to run a CPU search for months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Generating a vanity address is a brute-force exercise: try a random key, check the resulting address to see if it matches the desired pattern, repeat until successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vanity address security\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vanity addresses can be used to enhance and to defeat security measures; they are truly a double-edged sword**. Used to improve security, a distinctive address makes it harder for adversaries to substitute their own address and fool your customers into paying them instead of you. Unfortunately, vanity addresses also make it possible for anyone to create an address that resembles any random address, or even another vanity address which is similar to our vanity address, thereby fooling your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eugenia could advertise a randomly generated address (e.g., `1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy`) to which people can send their donations. Or, she could generate a vanity address that starts with `1Kids`, to make it more distinctive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, **one of the risks of using a single fixed address (rather than a separate dynamic address per donor) is that a thief might be able to infiltrate your website and replace it with his own address, thereby diverting donations to himself**. If you have advertised your donation address in a number of different places, your users may visually inspect the address before making a payment to ensure it is the same one they saw on your website, on your email, and on your flyer. In the case of a random address like `1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy`, the average user will perhaps inspect the first few characters \"1J7mdg\" and be satisfied that the address matches. Using a vanity address generator, someone with the intent to steal by substituting a similar-looking address can quickly generate addresses that match the first few characters, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/VanityAdd2MatchRandAdd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So does a vanity address increase security? If Eugenia generates the vanity address (1Kids) `1Kids33q44erFfpeXrmDSz7zEqG2FesZEN`, users are likely to look at the vanity pattern word and a few characters beyond, for example noticing the \"1Kids33\" part of the address. That would force an attacker to generate a vanity address matching at least six characters (two more), expending an effort that is 3,364 times (58 × 58) higher than the effort Eugenia expended for her 4-character vanity. Essentially, the effort Eugenia expends (or pays a vanity pool for) \"pushes\" the attacker into having to produce a longer pattern vanity. **If Eugenia pays a pool to generate an 8-character vanity address, the attacker would be pushed into the realm of 10 characters, which is infeasible on a personal computer and expensive even with a custom vanity-mining rig or vanity pool**. What is affordable for Eugenia becomes unaffordable for the attacker, especially if the potential reward of fraud is not high enough to cover the cost of the vanity address generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paper Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Paper wallets are bitcoin private keys printed on paper**. Often the paper wallet also includes the corresponding bitcoin address for convenience, but this is not necessary because it can be derived from the private key. Paper wallets are a very effective way to create backups or offline bitcoin storage, also known as **\"cold storage\"**. As a backup mechanism, a paper wallet can provide security against the loss of key due to a computer mishap such as a hard-drive failure, theft, or accidental deletion. As a \"cold storage\" mechanism, if the paper wallet keys are generated offline and never stored on a computer system, they are much more secure against hackers, keyloggers, and other online computer threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper wallets come in many shapes, sizes, and designs, but at a very basic level are just a key and an address printed on paper (Not Recommended due to Security Concerns). \n",
    "\n",
    "Paper wallets can be generated easily using a tool such as the client-side JavaScript generator at [Bit Address](http://bitaddress.org/). This page contains all the code necessary to generate keys and paper wallets, even while completely disconnected from the internet. To use it, save the HTML page on your local drive or on an external USB flash drive. Disconnect from the internet and open the file in a browser. Even better, boot your computer using a pristine operating system, such as a CD-ROM bootable Linux OS. Any keys generated with this tool while offline can be printed on a local printer over a USB cable (not wirelessly), thereby creating paper wallets whose keys exist only on the paper and have never been stored on any online system. Put these paper wallets in a fireproof safe and \"send\" bitcoin to their bitcoin address, to implement a simple yet highly effective \"cold storage\" solution. An example of a simple paper wallet from bitaddress.org is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/SimplePaperWallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of a simple paper wallet system is that the printed keys are vulnerable to theft. A thief who is able to gain access to the paper can either steal it or photograph the keys and take control of the bitcoin locked with those keys. **A more sophisticated paper wallet storage system uses BIP-38 encrypted private keys. The keys printed on the paper wallet are protected by a passphrase that the owner has memorized. Without the passphrase, the encrypted keys are useless**. Yet, they still are superior to a passphrase-protected wallet because the keys have never been online and must be physically retrieved from a safe or other physically secured storage. An example of an encrypted paper wallet from bitaddress.org:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EncryptedPaperWallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The private key starts with 6P which essentially means that the private key is BIP-38 encrypted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning:\n",
    "> Although you can deposit funds into a paper wallet several times, you should withdraw all funds only once, spending everything. This is because in the process of unlocking and spending funds some wallets might generate a change address if you spend less than the whole amount. Additionally, if the computer you use to sign the transaction is compromised, you risk exposing the private key. By spending the entire balance of a paper wallet only once, you reduce the risk of key compromise. If you need only a small amount, send any remaining funds to a new paper wallet in the same transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper wallets come in many designs and sizes, with many different features. Some are intended to be given as gifts and have seasonal themes, such as Christmas and New Year’s themes. Others are designed for storage in a bank vault or safe with the private key hidden in some way, either with opaque scratch-off stickers, or folded and sealed with tamper-proof adhesive foil. Figures below show various examples of paper wallets with security and backup features.\n",

    "# Wallets\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"wallet\" is used to describe a few different things in bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At a high level, a wallet is an application that serves as the primary user interface**. The wallet controls access to a user’s money, managing keys and addresses, tracking the balance, and creating and signing transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More narrowly, from a programmer’s perspective, the word \"wallet\" refers to the data structure used to store and manage a user’s keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, **we will look at the second meaning, where wallets are containers for private keys, usually implemented as structured files or simple databases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wallet Technology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we summarize the various technologies used to construct user-friendly, secure, and flexible bitcoin wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A common misconception about bitcoin is that bitcoin wallets contain bitcoin. In fact, **the wallet contains only keys. The \"coins\" are recorded in the blockchain on the bitcoin network**. Users control the coins on the network by signing transactions with the keys in their wallets. In a sense, a bitcoin wallet is a **keychain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Bitcoin wallets contain keys, not coins. Each user has a wallet containing keys. Wallets are really keychains containing pairs of private/public keys. **Users sign transactions with the keys, thereby proving they own the transaction outputs (their coins). The coins are stored on the blockchain in the form of transaction outputs (often noted as vout or txout)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two primary types of wallets, distinguished by whether the keys they contain are related to each other or not**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first type is a **nondeterministic wallet**, where each key is independently generated from a random number. The keys are not related to each other. This type of wallet is also known as a **JBOK wallet from the phrase \"Just a Bunch Of Keys\"**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second type of wallet is a **deterministic wallet**, where all the keys are derived from a single master key, known as the seed. All the keys in this type of wallet are related to each other and can be generated again if one has the original seed. There are a number of different key derivation methods used in deterministic wallets. The most **commonly used key derivation method uses a tree-like structure and is known as a hierarchical deterministic or HD wallet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic wallets are initialized from a seed. To make these easier to use, seeds are encoded as English words, also known as mnemonic code words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few sections introduce each of these technologies at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nondeterministic (Random) Wallets [Type-0]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first bitcoin wallet (now called Bitcoin Core), wallets were collections of randomly generated private keys. For example, the original Bitcoin Core client pregenerates 100 random private keys when first started and generates more keys as needed, using each key only once. **Such wallets are being replaced with deterministic wallets because they are cumbersome to manage, back up, and import**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The disadvantage of random keys is that if you generate many of them you must keep copies of all of them, meaning that the wallet must be backed up frequently**. Each key must be backed up, or the funds it controls are irrevocably lost if the wallet becomes inaccessible. This conflicts directly with the principle of avoiding address reuse, by using each bitcoin address for only one transaction. Address reuse reduces privacy by associating multiple transactions and addresses with each other. **A Type-0 nondeterministic wallet is a poor choice of wallet, especially if you want to avoid address reuse because it means that we would be using many keys to derive different addresses and from a  Type-0 wallet perspectives that mean managing many keys, which creates the need for frequent backups.** Although the Bitcoin Core client includes a Type-0 wallet, using this wallet is discouraged by developers of Bitcoin Core. Following depicts a nondeterministic wallet, containing a loose collection of random keys.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The use of nondeterministic wallets is discouraged for anything other than simple tests. They are simply too cumbersome to back up and use. Instead, **use an industry-standard–based HD wallet with a mnemonic seed for backup**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/NonDeterministic-Wallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets [Type-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic, or \"seeded,\" wallets are wallets that contain private keys that are all derived from a common seed, through the use of a one-way hash function**. The seed is a randomly generated number that is combined with other data, such as an index number or \"chain code\" (we will see that shortly) to derive the private keys. **In a deterministic wallet, the seed is sufficient to recover all the derived keys, and therefore a single backup at creation time is sufficient**. The seed is also sufficient for a wallet export or import, allowing for **easy migration of all the user’s keys between different wallet implementations**. Following depicts a logical diagram of a deterministic wallet:\n",

    "\n",
    "### HD Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44) [Type-2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic wallets were developed to make it easy to derive many keys from a single \"seed.\" The most advanced form of deterministic wallets is the HD wallet defined by the BIP-32 standard. **HD wallets contain keys derived in a tree structure, such that a parent key can derive a sequence of children keys, each of which can derive a sequence of grandchildren keys, and so on, to an infinite depth**. This tree structure is illustrated in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HD-Wallets.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "HD wallets offer two major advantages over random (nondeterministic) keys:\n",
    "- First, the tree structure can be used to express additional organizational meaning, such as when a specific branch of subkeys is used to receive incoming payments and a different branch is used to receive change from outgoing payments. Branches of keys can also be used in corporate settings, allocating different branches to departments, subsidiaries, specific functions, or accounting categories.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second advantage of HD wallets is that users can create a sequence of public keys without having access to the corresponding private keys. This allows HD wallets to be used on an insecure server or in a receive-only capacity, issuing a different public key for each transaction. The public keys do not need to be preloaded or derived in advance, yet the server doesn’t have the private keys that can spend the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "HD wallets are a very powerful mechanism for managing many keys and addresses. They are even more useful if they are combined with a **standardized way of creating seeds from a sequence of English words that are easy to transcribe, export, and import across wallets. This is known as a mnemonic and the standard is defined by BIP-39**. \n",
    "\n",

    "`army van defense carry jealous true garbage claim echo media make crunch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most bitcoin wallets (as well as wallets for other cryptocurrencies) use this standard and can import and export seeds for backup and recovery using interoperable mnemonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wallet Best Practices\n",
    "As bitcoin wallet technology has matured, certain common industry standards have emerged that make bitcoin wallets broadly interoperable, easy to use, secure, and flexible. These common standards are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mnemonic code words**, based on BIP-39\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HD wallets**, based on BIP-32\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multipurpose HD wallet structure**, based on BIP-43\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multicurrency and multiaccount wallets**, based on BIP-44\n",
    "\n",
    "These standards may change or may become obsolete by future developments, but for now they form a set of interlocking technologies that have become the de facto wallet standard for bitcoin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standards have been adopted by a broad range of software and hardware bitcoin wallets, making all these wallets interoperable. A user can export a mnemonic generated on one of these wallets and import it in another wallet, recovering all transactions, keys, and addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example of software wallets supporting these standards include (listed alphabetically) Breadwallet, Copay, Multibit HD, and Mycelium. Examples of hardware wallets supporting these standards include (listed alphabetically) Keepkey, Ledger, and Trezor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: If you are implementing a bitcoin wallet, it should be built as a HD wallet, with a seed encoded as mnemonic code for backup, following the BIP-32, BIP-39, BIP-43, and BIP-44 standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Bitcoin Wallet\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories](#Bitcoin-Uses,-Users,-and-Their-Stories) we introduced Gabriel, an enterprising young teenager in Rio de Janeiro, who is running a simple web store that sells bitcoin-branded t-shirts, coffee mugs, and stickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel uses a Trezor bitcoin hardware wallet to securely manage his bitcoin. The Trezor is a simple USB device with two buttons that stores keys (in the form of an HD wallet) and signs transactions. Trezor wallets implement all the industry standards discussed in this chapter, so Gabriel is not reliant on any proprietary technology or single vendor solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TrezorDevice.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When Gabriel used the Trezor for the first time, the device generated a mnemonic and seed from a built-in hardware random number generator. During this initialization phase, the wallet displayed a numbered sequence of words, one by one, on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "By writing down this mnemonic, Gabriel created a backup (as shown below) that can be used for recovery in the case of loss or damage to the Trezor device. This mnemonic can be used for recovery in a new Trezor or in any one of the many compatible software or hardware wallets. Note that the sequence of words is important, so mnemonic paper backups have numbered spaces for each word. Gabriel had to carefully record each word in the numbered space to preserve the correct sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PaperBackUpOfMnemonic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A 12-word mnemonic is shown in Gabriel’s paper backup of the mnemonic, for simplicity. In fact, **most hardware wallets generate a more secure 24-word mnemonic**. The mnemonic is used in exactly the same way, regardless of length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first implementation of his web store, Gabriel uses a single bitcoin address, generated on his Trezor device. This single address is used by all customers for all orders. As we will see, this approach has some drawbacks and can be improved upon with an HD wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wallet Technology Details\n",
    "Let’s now examine each of the important industry standards that are used by many bitcoin wallets in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mnemonic Code Words (BIP-39)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mnemonic code words are word sequences that represent a random number used as a seed to derive a deterministic wallet. The sequence of words is sufficient to re-create the seed and from there re-create the wallet and all the derived keys. A wallet application that implements deterministic wallets with mnemonic words will show the user a sequence of 12 to 24 words when first creating a wallet. That sequence of words is the wallet backup and can be used to recover and re-create all the keys in the same or any compatible wallet application. Mnemonic words make it easier for users to back up wallets because they are easy to read and correctly transcribe, as compared to a random sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mnemonic words are often confused with **brainwallets**. They are not the same. The primary difference is that a brainwallet consists of words chosen by the user, whereas mnemonic words are created randomly by the wallet and presented to the user. **This important difference makes mnemonic words much more secure, because humans are very poor sources of randomness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: BIP-39 has now achieved broad industry support across dozens of interoperable implementations and should be considered the de facto industry standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-39 defines the creation of a mnemonic code and seed, which we describe here in nine steps. For clarity, the process is split into two parts: steps 1 through 6 are shown in the image (Mnemonic Words) and steps 7 through 9 are shown in a later image(Mnemonic to Seed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating mnemonic words\n",
    "Mnemonic words are generated automatically by the wallet using the standardized process defined in BIP-39. The wallet starts from a source of entropy, adds a checksum, and then maps the entropy to a word list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a random sequence (entropy) of 128 to 256 bits, say from a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a checksum of the random sequence by taking the first (entropy-length/32, here 128/32) bits of its SHA256 hash.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the checksum to the end of the random sequence.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Split the result into 11-bit length segments.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Map each 11-bit value to a word from the predefined dictionary (BIP39 English Word List) of 2048 words.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The mnemonic code is the sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following depicts how entropy is used to generate mnemonic words:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/GenMnemonicWords.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following shows the relationship between the size of the entropy data and the length of mnemonic codes in words:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Entropy&WordLen.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From mnemonic to seed\n",
    "The mnemonic words represent entropy with a length of 128 to 256 bits. **The entropy is then used to derive a longer (512-bit) seed through the use of the key-stretching function PBKDF2**. The seed produced is then used to build a deterministic wallet and derive its keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key-stretching function takes two parameters: the mnemonic and a salt. **The purpose of a salt in a key-stretching function is to make it difficult to build a lookup table enabling a brute-force attack**. In the BIP-39 standard, the salt has another purpose—it allows the introduction of a passphrase that serves as an additional security factor protecting the seed, as we will describe in more detail under Optional passphrase in BIP-39.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process described in steps 7 through 9 continues from the process described previously in Generating mnemonic words:\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The first parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is the mnemonic produced from step 6.<br><br>\n",
    "8. The second parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is a salt. The salt is composed of the string constant \"mnemonic\" concatenated with an optional user-supplied passphrase string.<br><br>\n",
    "9. PBKDF2 stretches the mnemonic and salt parameters using 2048 rounds of hashing with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm, producing a 512-bit value as its final output. That 512-bit value is the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Mnemonic2Seed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **The key-stretching function, with its 2048 rounds of hashing, is a very effective protection against brute-force attacks against the mnemonic or the passphrase**. It makes it extremely costly (in computation) to try more than a few thousand passphrase and mnemonic combinations, while the number of possible derived seeds is vast ($2^{512}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Tables show some examples of mnemonic codes and the seeds they produce:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Mnemonic2Seed-Ex.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional passphrase in BIP-39\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIP-39 standard allows the use of an optional passphrase in the derivation of the seed. **If no passphrase is used, the mnemonic is stretched with a salt consisting of the constant string \"mnemonic\", producing a specific 512-bit seed from any given mnemonic**. If a passphrase is used, the stretching function produces a different seed from that same mnemonic. In fact, **given a single mnemonic, every possible passphrase leads to a different seed**. All passphrases are valid and they all lead to different seeds, forming a vast set of possible uninitialized wallets. **The set of possible wallets is so large ($2^{512}$) that there is no practical possibility of brute-forcing or accidentally guessing one that is in use.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are no \"wrong\" passphrases in BIP-39. Every passphrase leads to some wallet, which unless previously used will be empty. <br>**Each wallet is characterized by its seed, therefore as different passphrases, when undergo key-stretching function as salts alongside mnemonics, results in different seeds and therefore, we say, different wallets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional passphrase creates two important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A second factor (something memorized) that makes a mnemonic useless on its own, protecting mnemonic backups from compromise by a thief.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A form of plausible deniability or **duress wallet**, where a chosen passphrase leads to a wallet with a small amount of funds used to distract an attacker from the \"real\" wallet that contains the majority of funds, that is, different passphrase as salt with the mnemonic in the key-stretching function would result in different seed which would lead to different private keys which can take charge of different amount of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the use of a passphrase also introduces the risk of loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the wallet owner is incapacitated or dead and no one else knows the passphrase, the seed is useless and all the funds stored in the wallet are lost forever.\n",
    "- Conversely, if the owner backs up the passphrase in the same place as the seed, it defeats the purpose of a second factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "While passphrases are very useful, they should only be used in combination with a carefully planned process for backup and recovery, considering the possibility of surviving the owner and allowing his or her family to recover the cryptocurrency estate.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Creating an HD Wallet from the Seed\n",
    "HD wallets are created from a single root seed, which is a 128-, 256-, or 512-bit random number. Most commonly, this seed is generated from a mnemonic as detailed in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every key in the HD wallet is deterministically derived from this root seed, which makes it possible to re-create the entire HD wallet from that seed**. This makes it easy to back up, restore, export, and import HD wallets containing thousands or even millions of keys by **simply transferring only the mnemonic that the root seed is derived from**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating the master keys and master chain code for an HD wallet is shown in \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/MasterKey&ChainCode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The root seed is input into the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm and the resulting hash is used to create a master private key (m) and a master chain code (c).\n",
    "- The master private key (m) then generates a corresponding master public key (M) using the normal elliptic curve multiplication process m * G.\n",
    "- The **chain code (c) is used to introduce entropy in the function that creates child keys from parent keys**, as we will see in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Private child key derivation\n",
    "HD wallets use a child key derivation (CKD) function to derive child keys from parent keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child key derivation functions are based on a one-way hash function that combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A parent private or public key (ECDSA uncompressed key)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A seed called a chain code (256 bits)\n",
    "\n",
    "- An index number (32 bits) [can be interpreted as child number]\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain code is used to introduce deterministic random data to the process, so that knowing the index and a child key is not sufficient to derive other child keys. Knowing a child key does not make it possible to find its siblings, unless you also have the chain code. The initial chain code seed (at the root of the tree) is made from the seed, while subsequent child chain codes are derived from each parent chain code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**These three items (parent key, chain code, and index) are combined and hashed to generate children keys, as follows**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The parent public key, chain code, and the index number are combined and hashed with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm to produce a 512-bit hash. \n",
    "- This 512-bit hash is split into two 256-bit halves. The right-half 256 bits of the hash output become the chain code for the child (which would be used while deriving its child). \n",
    "- The left-half 256 bits of the hash are added to the parent private key to produce the child private key, which would then be used to derive the child public key using elliptic curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Parent2ChildKey.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above image illustrated with the index set to 0 to produce the \"zero\" (first by index) child of the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ques: Why is Public key 264 bit, while private key is 256?<br>\n",
    "Ans: It has an 8 bit prefix (tells whether y is even or odd) and 256 bit to represent coordinate x as seen earlier in the Generating public key section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changing the index allows us to extend the parent and create the other children in the sequence**, e.g., Child 0, Child 1, Child 2, etc. Each parent key can have 2,147,483,647 ($2^{31}$) children ($2^{31}$ is half of the entire $2^{32}$ range available because the other half is reserved for a special type of derivation, hardened derivation, which we will talk about later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating the process one level down the tree, each child can in turn become a parent and create its own children, in an infinite number of generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using derived child keys\n",
    "\n",
    "**Child private keys are indistinguishable from nondeterministic (random) keys**. Because the derivation function is a one-way function, the child key cannot be used to find the parent key. The child key also cannot be used to find any siblings. If you have the nth child, you cannot find its siblings, such as the n–1 child or the n+1 child, or any other children that are part of the sequence. Only the parent key and chain code can derive all the children. Without the child chain code, the child key cannot be used to derive any grandchildren either. You need both the child private key and the child chain code to start a new branch and derive grandchildren.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So what can the child private key be used for on its own?**<br> It can be used to make a public key and a bitcoin address. Then, it can be used to sign transactions to spend anything paid to that address.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A child private key, the corresponding public key, and the bitcoin address are all indistinguishable from keys and addresses created randomly. The fact that they are part of a sequence is not visible outside of the HD wallet function that created them. Once created, they operate exactly as \"normal\" keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extended keys\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, the key derivation function can be used to create children at any level of the tree, based on the three inputs: a key, a chain code, and the index of the desired child. The two essential ingredients are the key and chain code, and combined these are called an extended key. The term \"extended key\" could also be thought of as **\"extensible key\"** because such a key can be used to derive children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended keys are stored and represented simply as the concatenation of the 256-bit key and 256-bit chain code into a 512-bit sequence. There are two types of extended keys:\n",
    "- An **extended private key** is the combination of a private key and chain code and can be used to derive child private keys (and from them, child public keys). \n",
    "- An **extended public key** is a public key and chain code, which can be used to create child public keys (public only) as described in the next section (Public child key derivation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an extended key as the root of a branch in the tree structure of the HD wallet. With the root of the branch, you can derive the rest of the branch. The extended private key can create a complete branch, whereas the extended public key can only create a branch of public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    ">An extended key consists of a private or public key and chain code. An extended key can create children, generating its own branch in the tree structure. Sharing an extended key gives access to the entire branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended keys are encoded using Base58Check, to easily export and import between different BIP-32 compatible wallets. The Base58Check coding for extended keys uses a special version number that results in the prefix `xprv` and `xpub` when encoded in Base58 characters to make them easily recognizable. Because the extended key is 512 or 513 bits, it is also much longer than other Base58Check-encoded strings we have seen previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of an extended private key, encoded in Base58Check:\n",
    "`xprv9tyUQV64JT5qs3RSTJkXCWKMyUgoQp7F3hA1xzG6ZGu6u6Q9VMNjGr67Lctvy5P8oyaYAL9CAWrUE9i6GoNMKUga5biW6Hx4tws2six3b9c` \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the corresponding extended public key, encoded in Base58Check:\n",
    "`xpub67xpozcx8pe95XVuZLHXZeG6XWXHpGq6Qv5cmNfi7cS5mtjJ2tgypeQbBs2UAR6KECeeMVKZBPLrtJunSDMstweyLXhRgPxdp14sk9tJPW9`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public child key derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, a very useful characteristic of HD wallets is the ability to derive public child keys from public parent keys, without having the private keys. This gives us two ways to derive a child public key: either from the child private key, or directly from the parent public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **extended public key can be used, therefore, to derive all of the public keys (and only the public keys) in that branch of the HD wallet structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**This shortcut can be used to create very secure public key-only deployments where a server or application has a copy of an extended public key and no private keys whatsoever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public keys and bitcoin addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those addresses. Meanwhile, on another, more secure server, the extended private key can derive all the corresponding private keys to sign transactions and spend the money.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One common application of this solution is to install an extended public key on a web server that serves an ecommerce application. The web server can use the public key derivation function to create a new bitcoin address for every transaction (e.g., for a customer shopping cart). The web server will not have any private keys that would be vulnerable to theft. Without HD wallets, the only way to do this is to generate thousands of bitcoin addresses on a separate secure server and then preload them on the ecommerce server. That approach is cumbersome and requires constant maintenance to ensure that the ecommerce server doesn’t \"run out\" of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common application of this solution is for cold-storage or hardware wallets. In that scenario, the extended private key can be stored on a paper wallet or hardware device (such as a Trezor hardware wallet), while the extended public key can be kept online. The user can create \"receive\" addresses at will, while the private keys are safely stored offline. To spend the funds, the user can use the extended private key on an offline signing bitcoin client or sign transactions on the hardware wallet device (e.g., Trezor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following illustrates the mechanism for extending a parent public key to derive child public keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ExtendingParentPubKey.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using an Extended Public Key on a Web Store\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how HD wallets are used by continuing our story with Gabriel’s web store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel first set up his web store as a hobby, based on a simple hosted Wordpress page. His store was quite basic with only a few pages and an order form with a single bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel used the first bitcoin address generated by his Trezor device as the main bitcoin address for his store. This way, all incoming payments would be paid to an address controlled by his Trezor hardware wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers would submit an order using the form and send payment to Gabriel’s published bitcoin address, triggering an email with the order details for Gabriel to process. With just a few orders each week, this system worked well enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the little web store became quite successful and attracted many orders from the local community. Soon, Gabriel was overwhelmed. With all the orders paying the same address, it became difficult to correctly match orders and transactions, especially when multiple orders for the same amount came in close together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel’s HD wallet offers a much better solution through the ability to derive public child keys without knowing the private keys. **Gabriel can load an extended public key (xpub) on his website, which can be used to derive a unique address for every customer order. Gabriel can spend the funds from his Trezor, but the xpub loaded on the website can only generate addresses and receive funds**. This feature of HD wallets is a great security feature. Gabriel’s website does not contain any private keys and therefore does not need high levels of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export the xpub, Gabriel uses the web-based software in conjunction with the Trezor hardware wallet. The Trezor device must be plugged in for the public keys to be exported. Note that hardware wallets will never export private keys—those always remain on the device. Following shows the web interface Gabriel uses to export the xpub from Trezor hardware wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ExportxpubFromTrezor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabriel copies the xpub to his web store’s bitcoin shop software. He uses Mycelium Gear, which is an open source web-store plugin for a variety of web hosting and content platforms. Mycelium Gear uses the xpub to generate a unique address for every purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardened child key derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem:<br>\n",
    "The ability to derive a branch of public keys from an xpub is very useful, but it comes with a potential risk. Access to an xpub does not give access to child private keys. However, **because the xpub contains the chain code, if a child private key is known, or somehow leaked, it can be used with the chain code to derive all the other child private keys. A single leaked child private key, together with a parent chain code, reveals all the private keys of all the children**. Worse, the child private key together with a parent chain code can be used to deduce the parent private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:<br>\n",
    "To counter this risk, HD wallets use an **alternative derivation function called hardened derivation, which \"breaks\" the relationship between parent public key and child chain code**. The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a \"firewall\" in the parent/child sequence, with a chain code that cannot be used to compromise a parent or sibling private key. **The hardened derivation function looks almost identical to the normal child private key derivation, except that the parent private key is used as input to the hash function, instead of the parent public key**, as shown in the diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HardenedDerivation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the hardened private derivation function is used, the resulting child private key and chain code are completely different from what would result from the normal derivation function. **The resulting \"branch\" of keys can be used to produce extended public keys that are not vulnerable, because the chain code they contain cannot be exploited to reveal any private keys. Hardened derivation is therefore used to create a \"gap\" in the tree above the level where extended public keys are used**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing:\n",
    ">In simple terms, if you want to use the convenience of an xpub to derive branches of public keys, without exposing yourself to the risk of a leaked chain code, **you should derive it from a hardened parent, rather than a normal parent. As a best practice, the level-1 children of the master keys are always derived through the hardened derivation, to prevent compromise of the master keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index numbers for normal and hardened derivation\n",
    "The index number used in the derivation function is a 32-bit integer. To easily distinguish between keys derived through the normal derivation function versus keys derived through hardened derivation, this index number is split into two ranges. **Index numbers between 0 and $2^{31}$ – 1 (0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF) are used only for normal derivation. Index numbers between $2^{31}$ and $2^{32}$ - 1 (0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF) are used only for hardened derivation**. Therefore, if the index number is less than $2^{31}$, the child is normal, whereas if the index number is equal or above $2^{31}$, the child is hardened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make the index number easier to read and display, the index number for hardened children is displayed starting from zero, but with a prime symbol**. The first normal child key is therefore displayed as 0, whereas the first hardened child (index 0x80000000) is displayed as 0&#x27;. In sequence then, the second hardened key would have index 0x80000001 and would be displayed as 1&#x27;, and so on. When you see an HD wallet index i&#x27;, that means $2^{31}$+i.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HD wallet key identifier (path)\n",
    "Keys in an HD wallet are identified using a \"path\" naming convention, with each level of the tree separated by a slash (/) character (see HD wallet path examples). Private keys derived from the master private key start with \"m.\" Public keys derived from the master public key start with \"M.\" Therefore, the first child private key of the master private key is m/0. The first child public key is M/0. The second grandchild of the first child is m/0/1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**The \"ancestry\" of a key is read from right to left, until you reach the master key from which it was derived**.<br>\n",
    "For example, identifier m/x/y/z describes the key that is the z-th child of key m/x/y, which is the y-th child of key m/x, which is the x-th child of m.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HDWalletPathEx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Navigating the HD wallet tree structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The HD wallet tree structure offers tremendous flexibility. Each parent extended key can have 4 billion children: 2 billion normal children and 2 billion hardened children. Each of those children can have another 4 billion children, and so on. The tree can be as deep as you want, with an infinite number of generations. With all that flexibility, however, it becomes quite difficult to navigate this infinite tree. **It is especially difficult to transfer HD wallets between implementations, because the possibilities for internal organization into branches and subbranches are endless.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two BIPs, BIP-43 and BIP-44, offer a solution to this complexity by creating some proposed standards for the structure of HD wallet trees**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**BIP-43 proposes the use of the first hardened child index as a special identifier that signifies the \"purpose\" of the tree structure**. Based on BIP-43, an HD wallet should use only one level-1 branch of the tree, with the index number identifying the structure and namespace of the rest of the tree by defining its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an HD wallet using only branch m/i&#x27;/ is intended to signify a specific purpose and that purpose is identified by index number \"i\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extending that specification, BIP-44 proposes a multi-account structure as \"purpose\" number 44' under BIP-43**. All HD wallets following the BIP-44 structure are identified by the fact that they only used one branch of the tree: m/44'/.\n",
    "\n",
    "BIP-44 specifies the structure as consisting of five predefined tree levels:<br>\n",
    "`m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **first-level \"purpose\"** is always set to 44' signifying **multi-currency/multi-account structure**. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **second-level \"coin_type\" specifies the type of cryptocurrency coin**, allowing for multicurrency HD wallets where each currency has its own subtree under the second level. There are three currencies defined for now: Bitcoin is m/44'/0', Bitcoin Testnet is m/44&#x27;/1&#x27;, and Litecoin is m/44&#x27;/2&#x27;. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **third level of the tree is \"account,\" which allows users to subdivide their wallets into separate logical subaccounts**, for accounting or organizational purposes. For example, an HD wallet might contain two bitcoin \"accounts\": m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27; and m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/1&#x27;. Each account is the root of its own subtree. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the **fourth level, \"change,\" an HD wallet has two subtrees, one for creating receiving addresses and one for creating change addresses**. Note that whereas the previous levels used hardened derivation, this level uses normal derivation. This is to allow this level of the tree to export extended public keys for use in a nonsecured environment.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- Usable addresses are derived by the HD wallet as children of the fourth level, making the **fifth level of the tree the \"address_index\"**. This is the level from where we start generating keys in order to derive addresses. For example, the third receiving address for bitcoin payments in the primary account would be M/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27;/0/2. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions are the most important part of the bitcoin system**. Everything else in bitcoin is designed to ensure that transactions can be created, propagated on the network, validated, and finally added to the global ledger of transactions (the blockchain). \n",
    ">**Transactions are data structures that encode the transfer of value between participants in the bitcoin system**. **Each transaction is a public entry in bitcoin’s blockchain, the global double-entry bookkeeping ledger**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will examine all the various forms of transactions, what they contain, how to create them, how they are verified, and how they become part of the permanent record of all transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When we use the term \"wallet\" in this section, we are referring to the software that constructs transactions, not just the database of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transactions in Detail\n",
    "In [How Bitcoin Works](#How-Bitcoin-Works) under Buying a cup of Coffee, we looked at the transaction Alice used to pay for coffee at Bob’s coffee shop using a block explorer (Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe).\n",
    "\n",
    "The block explorer application shows a transaction from Alice’s \"address\" to Bob’s \"address.\" This is a much simplified view of what is contained in a transaction. In fact, as we will see in this section, much of the information shown is constructed by the block explorer and is not actually in the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Alice2BobTransac.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as a bitcoin search engine, in that it allows you to search for addresses, transactions, and blocks and see the relationships and flows between them. Ex: [BlockCypher Explorer](https://live.blockcypher.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transactions—Behind the Scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, an actual transaction looks very different from a transaction provided by a typical block explorer. **In fact, most of the high-level constructs, such as senders/recipients address, balances, coins etc., that we see in the various bitcoin application user interfaces do not actually exist in the bitcoin system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Bitcoin Core’s command-line interface (getrawtransaction and decoderawtransaction) to retrieve Alice’s \"raw\" transaction, decode it, and see what it contains. The result looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s transaction decoded:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AliceTransacDecoded.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice a few things about this transaction, mostly the things that are missing!<br> \n",
    "**Where is Alice’s address? Where is Bob’s address? Where is the 0.1 input \"sent\" by Alice?** <br>\n",
    ">In bitcoin system, there are **no coins, no senders, no recipients, no balances, no accounts, and no addresses**. All those things are constructed at a higher level for the benefit of the user, to make things easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also notice a lot of strange and indecipherable fields and hexadecimal strings. Don’t worry, we will explain each field shown here in detail in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction Outputs and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fundamental building block of a bitcoin transaction is a transaction output**. Transaction outputs are indivisible chunks of bitcoin currency, recorded on the blockchain, and recognized as valid by the entire network. **Bitcoin full nodes track all available and spendable outputs, known as unspent transaction outputs, or UTXO. The collection of all UTXO is known as the UTXO set** and currently numbers in the millions of UTXO. The UTXO set grows as new UTXO is created and shrinks when UTXO is consumed. **Every transaction represents a change (state transition) in the UTXO set.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When we say that a user’s wallet has \"received\" bitcoin, what we mean is that the wallet has detected an UTXO that can be spent with one of the keys controlled by that walle**t. Thus, a user’s bitcoin \"balance\" is the sum of all UTXO that user’s wallet can spend and which may be scattered among hundreds of transactions and hundreds of blocks. The concept of a balance is created by the wallet application. **The wallet calculates the user’s balance by scanning the blockchain and aggregating the value of any UTXO the wallet can spend with the keys it controls. Most wallets maintain a database or use a database service to store a quick reference set of all the UTXO they can spend with the keys they control**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction output can have an arbitrary (integer) value denominated as a multiple of satoshis. Just as dollars can be divided down to two decimal places as cents, bitcoin can be divided down to eight decimal places as satoshis. **Although an output can have any arbitrary value, once created it is indivisible. This is an important characteristic of outputs that needs to be emphasized: outputs are discrete and indivisible units of value, denominated in integer satoshis. An unspent output can only be consumed in its entirety by a transaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If an UTXO is larger than the desired value of a transaction, it must still be consumed in its entirety and change must be generated in the transaction. In other words, if you have an UTXO worth 20 bitcoin and want to pay only 1 bitcoin, your transaction must consume the entire 20-bitcoin UTXO and produce two outputs: one paying 1 bitcoin to your desired recipient and another paying 19 bitcoin in change back to your wallet. As a result of the indivisible nature of transaction outputs, most bitcoin transactions will have to generate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a shopper buying a $\\$$1.50 beverage, reaching into her wallet and trying to find a combination of coins and bank notes to cover the $\\$$1.50 cost. The shopper will choose exact change if available e.g. a dollar bill and two quarters (a quarter is $\\$$0.25), or a combination of smaller denominations (six quarters), or if necessary, a larger unit such as a $\\$$5 note. If she hands too much money, say $\\$$5, to the shop owner, she will expect $\\$$3.50 change, which she will return to her wallet and have available for future transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, **a bitcoin transaction must be created from a user’s UTXO in whatever denominations that user has available. Users cannot cut an UTXO in half any more than they can cut a dollar bill in half and use it as currency**. The user’s wallet application will typically select from the user’s available UTXO to compose an amount greater than or equal to the desired transaction amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with real life, the bitcoin application can use several strategies to satisfy the purchase amount: combining several smaller units, finding exact change, or using a single unit larger than the transaction value and making change. All of this complex assembly of spendable UTXO is done by the user’s wallet automatically and is invisible to users. It is only relevant if you are programmatically constructing raw transactions from UTXO.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A transaction consumes previously recorded unspent transaction outputs and creates new transaction outputs that can be consumed by a future transaction**. This way, chunks of bitcoin value move forward from owner to owner in a chain of transactions consuming and creating UTXO.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception to the output and input chain is a special type of transaction called the **coinbase transaction, which is the first transaction in each block. This transaction is placed there by the \"winning\" miner and creates brand-new bitcoin payable to that miner as a reward for mining. This special coinbase transaction does not consume UTXO**; instead, it has a special type of input called the \"coinbase.\" This is how bitcoin’s money supply is created during the mining process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What comes first? Inputs or outputs**, the chicken or the egg?<br> \n",
    "Strictly speaking, **outputs come first because coinbase transactions, which generate new bitcoin, have no inputs and create outputs from nothing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Every bitcoin transaction creates outputs, which are recorded on the bitcoin ledger. **Almost all of these outputs, with one exception create spendable chunks of bitcoin called UTXO**, which are then recognized by the whole network and available for the owner to spend in a future transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTXO are tracked by every full-node bitcoin client in the UTXO set. **New transactions consume (spend) one or more of these outputs from the UTXO set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction outputs consist of two parts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **amount/value of bitcoin**, denominated in satoshis, the smallest bitcoin unit\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **cryptographic puzzle** that determines the conditions required to spend the output. The cryptographic puzzle is also known as a **locking script, a witness script, or a scriptPubKey**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transaction scripting language, used in the locking script mentioned previously, is discussed in detail in Transaction Scripts and Script Language section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s look at Alice’s transaction (shown previously in Transactions—Behind the Scenes) and see if we can identify the outputs. **In the JSON encoding, the outputs are in an array (list) named vout**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/AliceTransactionJSON.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the transaction contains two outputs. Each output is defined by a value and a cryptographic puzzle. In the encoding shown by Bitcoin Core, the value is shown in bitcoin, but in the transaction itself it is recorded as an integer denominated in satoshis. The second part of each output is the cryptographic puzzle that sets the conditions for spending. Bitcoin Core shows this as scriptPubKey and shows us a human-readable representation of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of locking and unlocking UTXO will be discussed later, in Script Construction (Lock + Unlock). The scripting language that is used for the script in scriptPubKey is discussed in Transaction Scripts and Script Language. But before we delve into those topics, we need to understand the overall structure of transaction inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction serialization—outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "When transactions are transmitted over the network or exchanged between applications, they are serialized. Serialization is the process of converting the internal representation of a data structure into a format that can be transmitted one byte at a time, also known as a byte stream. **Serialization is most commonly used for encoding data structures for transmission over a network or for storage in a file**. The serialization format of a transaction output is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransactionOutputSerialize.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most bitcoin libraries and frameworks do not store transactions internally as byte-streams, as that would require complex parsing every time you needed to access a single field. For convenience and readability, bitcoin libraries store transactions internally in data structures (usually object-oriented structures).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The process of converting from the byte-stream representation of a transaction to a library’s internal representation data structure is called deserialization or transaction parsing**. The process of converting back to a byte-stream for transmission over the network, for hashing, or for storage on disk is called serialization. Most bitcoin libraries have built-in functions for transaction serialization and deserialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can manually decode Alice’s transaction from the serialized hexadecimal form, finding some of the elements we saw previously. The section containing the two outputs is highlighted in Alice’s transaction, serialized and presented in hexadecimal notation to help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Alice’s transaction shown under [Transactions—Behind the Scenes](#Transactions—Behind-the-Scenes), serialized and presented in hexadecimal notation (contains input, which we will discover later in Example 2, followed by output):\n",
    "\n",
    "0100000001186f9f998a5aa6f048e51dd8419a14d8a0f1a8a2836dd73 4d2804fe65fa35779000000008b483045022100884d142d86652a3f47 ba4746ec719bbfbd040a570b1deccbb6498c75c4ae24cb02204b9f039 ff08df09cbe9f6addac960298cad530a863ea8f53982c09db8f6e3813 01410484ecc0d46f1918b30928fa0e4ed99f16a0fb4fde0735e7ade84 16ab9fe423cc5412336376789d172787ec3457eee41c04f4938de5cc1 7b4a10fa336a8d752adfffffffff02**60e31600000000001976a914ab6 8025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e788acd0ef800000000000 1976a9147f9b1a7fb68d60c536c2fd8aeaa53a8f3cc025a888ac**00000000\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two outputs in the highlighted section, each serialized as shown in Transaction output serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value of 0.015 bitcoin is 1,500,000 satoshis. That’s 16 e3 60 in hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the serialized transaction, the value 16 e3 60 is encoded in little-endian (least-significant-byte-first) byte order, so it looks like 60 e3 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scriptPubKey length is 25 bytes, which is 19 in hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction inputs identify (by reference) which UTXO will be consumed and provide proof of ownership through an unlocking script.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a transaction, a wallet selects from the UTXO it controls, UTXO with enough value to make the requested payment. Sometimes one UTXO is enough, other times more than one is needed. For each UTXO that will be consumed to make this payment, the wallet creates one input pointing to the UTXO and unlocks it with an unlocking script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the components of an input in greater detail:\n",
    "- The **first part of an input is a pointer to an UTXO** by reference to the transaction hash and an output index, which identifies the specific UTXO in that transaction.\n",
    "- The **second part is an unlocking script**, which the wallet constructs in order to satisfy the spending conditions set in the UTXO. **Most often, the unlocking script is a digital signature and public key proving ownership of the bitcoin**. However, not all unlocking scripts contain signatures. \n",
    "- The **third part is a sequence number**, which will be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our example in Transactions—Behind the Scenes. **The transaction inputs are an array (list) called vin**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TransactionInpInAliceTransac.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there is only one input in the list (because one UTXO contained sufficient value to make this payment). The input contains four elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **transaction ID** (txid), referencing the transaction that contains the UTXO being spent\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **output index** (vout), identifying which UTXO from that transaction is referenced (first one is zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **scriptSig**, also referred to as unlocking script, a which satisfies the conditions placed on the UTXO (in its locking-script/scriptPubKey), unlocking it for spending\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **sequence number** (to be discussed later)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Alice’s transaction, the input points to the transaction ID:\n",
    "`7957a35fe64f80d234d76d83a2a8f1a0d8149a41d81de548f0a65a8a999f6f18`<br>\n",
    "and output index 0 (i.e., the first UTXO created by that transaction). \n",
    ">**The unlocking script is constructed by Alice’s wallet by**:\n",
    "- first retrieving the referenced UTXO\n",
    "- examining its locking script (also referred as scriptPubKey/cryptographic-puzzle)\n",
    "- then using it to build the necessary unlocking-script/scriptSig to satisfy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fetching the UTXO for Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking just at the input you may have noticed that we don’t know anything about this UTXO, other than a reference to the transaction containing it. **We don’t know its value (amount in satoshi), and we don’t know the locking script that sets the conditions for spending it**. To find this information, **we must retrieve the referenced UTXO by retrieving the underlying transaction**. Notice that because the value of the input is not explicitly stated, we must also use the referenced UTXO in order to calculate the fees that will be paid in this transaction (see Transaction Fees).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It’s not just Alice’s wallet that needs to retrieve UTXO referenced in the inputs. Once this transaction is broadcast to the network, every validating node will also need to retrieve the UTXO referenced in the transaction inputs in order to validate the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transactions on their own seem incomplete because they lack context**. They reference UTXO in their inputs but without retrieving that UTXO we cannot know the value of the inputs or their locking conditions. When writing bitcoin software, anytime you decode a transaction with the intent of validating it or counting the fees or checking the unlocking script, your code will first have to retrieve the referenced UTXO from the blockchain in order to build the context implied but not present in the UTXO references of the inputs. For example, to calculate the amount paid in fees, you must know the sum of the values of inputs and outputs. But without retrieving the UTXO referenced in the inputs, you do not know their value. So a seemingly simple operation like counting fees in a single transaction in fact involves multiple steps and data from multiple transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same sequence of commands with Bitcoin Core as we used when retrieving Alice’s transaction (getrawtransaction and decoderawtransaction). With that we can get the UTXO referenced in the input and take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice’s UTXO from the previous transaction (when she exchanged 0.10 BTC for 10 USD from her friend Joe, if you remember), referenced in the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Alice'sUTXOFromPrevTransec.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that this UTXO has a value of 0.1 BTC and that it has a locking script (scriptPubKey) that contains \"OP_DUP OP_HASH160…\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: To fully understand Alice’s present transaction we had to retrieve the previous transaction(s) referenced in/as inputs. A function that retrieves previous transactions and unspent transaction outputs is very common and exists in almost every bitcoin library and API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction serialization—inputs\n",
    "When transactions are serialized for transmission on the network, their inputs are encoded into a byte stream as shown below:\n",

    "### Transaction Fees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most transactions include transaction fees, which compensate the bitcoin miners for securing the network. Fees also serve as a security mechanism themselves, by making it economically infeasible for attackers to flood the network with transactions**. Mining and the fees and rewards collected by miners would be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section examines how transaction fees are included in a typical transaction. **Most wallets calculate and include transaction fees automatically**. However, if you are constructing transactions programmatically, or using a command-line interface, you must manually account for and include these fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction fees serve as an incentive to include (mine) a transaction into the next block and also as a disincentive against abuse of the system by imposing a small cost on every transaction**. Transaction fees are collected by the miner who mines the block that records the transaction on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transaction fees are calculated based on the size of the transaction in kilobytes, not the value of the transaction in bitcoin. Overall, transaction fees are set based on market forces within the bitcoin network**. Miners prioritize transactions based on many different criteria, including fees, and might even process transactions for free under certain circumstances. Transaction fees affect the processing priority, meaning that **a transaction with sufficient fees is likely to be included in the next block mined, whereas a transaction with insufficient or no fees might be delayed, processed on a best-effort basis after a few blocks, or not processed at all**. Transaction fees are not mandatory, and transactions without fees might be processed eventually; however, including transaction fees encourages priority processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the way transaction fees are calculated and the effect they have on transaction prioritization has evolved:\n",
    "- At first, transaction fees were fixed and constant across the network. \n",
    "- Gradually, the fee structure relaxed and may be influenced by market forces, based on network capacity and transaction volume. - Since at least the beginning of 2016, capacity limits in bitcoin have created competition between transactions, resulting in higher fees and effectively making free transactions a thing of the past. **Zero fee or very low fee transactions rarely get mined and sometimes will not even be propagated across the network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bitcoin Core, fee relay policies are set by the minrelaytxfee option. The current default minrelaytxfee is 0.00001 bitcoin or a hundredth of a millibitcoin per kilobyte. Therefore, by default, transactions with a fee less than 0.00001 bitcoin are treated as free and are only relayed if there is space in the mempool; otherwise, they are dropped. Bitcoin nodes can override the default fee relay policy by adjusting the value of minrelaytxfee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any bitcoin service that creates transactions, including wallets, exchanges, retail applications, etc., must implement dynamic fees. **Dynamic fees can be implemented through a third-party fee estimation service or with a built-in fee estimation algorithm**. If you’re unsure, begin with a third-party service and as you gain experience design and implement your own algorithm if you wish to remove the third-party dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fee estimation algorithms calculate the appropriate fee, based on capacity and the fees offered by \"competing\" transactions.** These algorithms range from simplistic (average or median fee in the last block) to sophisticated (statistical analysis). They estimate the necessary fee (in satoshis per byte) that will give a transaction a high probability of being selected and included within a certain number of blocks. Most services offer users the option of choosing high, medium, or low priority fees. **High priority means users pay higher fees but the transaction is likely to be included in the next block. Medium and low priority means users pay lower transaction fees but the transactions may take much longer to confirm.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many wallet applications use third-party services for fee calculations. One popular service is http://bitcoinfees.21.co, which provides an API and a visual chart showing the fee in satoshi/byte for different priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Static fees are no longer viable on the bitcoin network. **Wallets that set static fees will produce a poor user experience as transactions will often get \"stuck\" and remain unconfirmed**. Users who don’t understand bitcoin transactions and fees are dismayed by \"stuck\" transactions because they think they’ve lost their money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart below, Fee estimation service by bitcoinfees.21.co, shows the real-time estimate of fees in 10 satoshi/byte increments and the expected confirmation time (in minutes and number of blocks) for transactions with fees in each range. For each fee range (e.g., 61–70 satoshi/byte), two horizontal bars show the number of unconfirmed transactions (1405) and total number of transactions in the past 24 hours (102,975), with fees in that range. Based on the graph, the recommended high-priority fee at this time was 80 satoshi/byte, a fee likely to result in the transaction being mined in the very next block (zero block delay). For perspective, the median transaction size is 226 bytes, so the recommended fee for a transaction size would be 18,080 satoshis (0.00018080 BTC).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Feeestimationservice.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The fee estimation data can be retrieved via a simple HTTP REST API, at https://bitcoinfees.21.co/api/v1/fees/recommended. For example, on the command line using the curl command:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/FeeEstimationAPI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The API returns a JSON object with the current fee estimate for fastest confirmation (fastestFee), confirmation within three blocks (halfHourFee) and six blocks (hourFee), in satoshi per byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Fees to Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure of transactions does not have a field for fees. Instead, fees are implied as the difference between the sum of inputs and the sum of outputs. Any excess amount that remains after all outputs have been deducted from all inputs is the fee that is collected by the miners:\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction fees are implied, as the excess of inputs minus outputs:<br>\n",
    "`Fees = Sum(Inputs) – Sum(Outputs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a somewhat confusing element of transactions and an important point to understand, because **if you are constructing your own transactions you must ensure you do not inadvertently include a very large fee by underspending the inputs**. That means that you must account for all inputs, if necessary by creating change, or you will end up giving the miners a very big tip!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, **if you consume a 20-bitcoin UTXO to make a 1-bitcoin payment, you must include a 19-bitcoin change output back to your wallet (this is when we are constructing our own transaction as a developer, else the present wallets will automatically handle the change and fee issue). Otherwise, the 19-bitcoin \"leftover\" will be counted as a transaction fee and will be collected by the miner who mines your transaction in a block**. Although you will receive priority processing and make a miner very happy, this is probably not what you intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: \n",
    ">If you forget to add a change output in a manually constructed transaction, you will be paying the change as a transaction fee. \"Keep the change!\" might not be what you intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Alice Coffee Purchase<br>\n",
    "Let’s see how this works in practice, by looking at Alice’s coffee purchase again. Alice wants to spend 0.015 bitcoin to pay for coffee. To ensure this transaction is processed promptly, she will want to include a transaction fee, say 0.001. That will mean that the total cost of the transaction will be 0.016. Her wallet must therefore source a set of UTXO that adds up to 0.016 bitcoin or more and, if necessary, create change. Let’s say her wallet has a 0.2-bitcoin UTXO available. It will therefore need to consume this UTXO, create one output to Bob’s Cafe for 0.015, and a second output with 0.184 bitcoin in change back to her own wallet, leaving 0.001 bitcoin unallocated, as an implicit fee for the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Eugenia, Children's Charity director<br>\n",
    "Now let’s look at a different scenario. Eugenia, our children’s charity director in the Philippines, has completed a fundraiser to purchase schoolbooks for the children. She received several thousand small donations from people all around the world, totaling 50 bitcoin, so her wallet is full of very small payments (UTXO). Now she wants to purchase hundreds of schoolbooks from a local publisher, paying in bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Eugenia’s wallet application tries to construct a single larger payment transaction, it must source from the available UTXO set, which is composed of many smaller amounts. That means that the resulting transaction will source from more than a hundred small-value UTXO as inputs and only one output, paying the book publisher. A transaction with that many inputs will be larger than one kilobyte, perhaps several kilobytes in size. As a result, it will require a much higher fee than the median-sized transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eugenia’s wallet application will calculate the appropriate fee by measuring the size of the transaction and multiplying that by the per-kilobyte fee. Many wallets will overpay fees for larger transactions to ensure the transaction is processed promptly. The higher fee is not because Eugenia is spending more money, but because her transaction is more complex and larger in size, the fee is independent of the transaction’s bitcoin value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight:\n",
    "> **As transaction fees are calculated based on the size of the transaction in kilobytes, not the value of the transaction in bitcoin.** Therefore, it might seem preferable to have, where ever possible, a one large bitcoin payment rather than multiple small payment. As at the time of spending, for a single large UTXO, the size of the transaction, in kilobytes, would be low leading to low transaction fee. Whereas many small UTXO that add up to a large value, would naturally mean that the size of transaction would be large and hence would incur more transaction fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction Scripts and Script Language\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin transaction script language, called Script, is a Forth-like reverse-polish notation stack-based execution language. If that sounds like gibberish, you probably haven’t studied 1960s programming languages, but that’s ok—we will explain it all in this section. Both the locking script placed on an UTXO and the unlocking script are written in this scripting language. **When a transaction is validated, the unlocking script in each input is executed alongside the corresponding UTXO's locking script to see if it satisfies the spending condition.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Script is a very simple language that was designed to be limited in scope and executable on a range of hardware, perhaps as simple as an embedded device**. It requires minimal processing and cannot do many of the fancy things modern programming languages can do. For its use in validating programmable money, this is a deliberate security feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most transactions processed through the bitcoin network have the form \"Payment to Bob’s bitcoin address\" and are based on a script called a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash script. However, bitcoin transactions are not limited to the \"Payment to Bob’s bitcoin address\" script. In fact, locking scripts can be written to express a vast variety of complex conditions. In order to understand these more complex scripts, we must first understand the basics of transaction scripts and script language.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Bitcoin transaction validation is not based on a static pattern, but instead is achieved through the execution of a scripting language. This language allows for a nearly infinite variety of conditions to be expressed. This is how bitcoin gets the power of \"programmable money.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will demonstrate the basic components of the bitcoin transaction scripting language and show how it can be used to express simple conditions for spending and how those conditions can be satisfied by unlocking scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turing Incompleteness\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitcoin transaction script language contains many operators, but is deliberately limited in one important way—**there are no loops or complex flow control capabilities other than conditional flow control. This ensures that the language is not Turing Complete, meaning that scripts have limited complexity and predictable execution times**. Script is not a general-purpose language. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These limitations ensure that the language cannot be used to create an infinite loop or other form of \"logic bomb\" that could be embedded in a transaction in a way that causes a denial-of-service attack against the bitcoin network**. Remember, every transaction is validated by every full node on the bitcoin network. A limited language prevents the transaction validation mechanism from being used as a vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateless Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "**The bitcoin transaction script language is stateless, in that there is no state prior to execution of the script, or state saved after execution of the script**. Therefore, all the information needed to execute a script is contained within the script. **A script will predictably execute the same way on any system**. If your system verifies a script, you can be sure that every other system in the bitcoin network will also verify the script, meaning that a valid transaction is valid for everyone and everyone knows this. This predictability of outcomes is an essential benefit of the bitcoin system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Construction (Lock + Unlock)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bitcoin’s transaction validation engine relies on two types of scripts to validate transactions**: \n",
    "- a locking script, and \n",
    "- an unlocking script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locking Script:<br> \n",
    "**A locking script is a spending condition placed on an output: it specifies the conditions that must be met to spend the output in the future. Historically, the locking script was called a scriptPubKey, because it usually contained a public key or bitcoin address (public key hash)**. In this notebook we refer to it as a \"locking script\" to acknowledge the much broader range of possibilities of this scripting technology. **In most bitcoin applications, what we refer to as a locking script will appear in the source code as scriptPubKey**. You will also see the locking script referred to as a witness script or more generally as a cryptographic puzzle. These terms all mean the same thing, at different levels of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlocking Script:<br>\n",
    "**An unlocking script is a script that \"solves,\" or satisfies, the conditions placed on an output by a locking script and allows the output to be spent. Unlocking scripts are part of every transaction input. Most of the time they contain a digital signature produced by the user’s wallet from his or her private key**. Historically, the unlocking script was called **scriptSig**, because it usually contained a digital signature. In most bitcoin applications, the source code refers to the unlocking script as scriptSig. You will also see the unlocking script referred to as a witness. In this notebook, we refer to it as an \"unlocking script\" to acknowledge the much broader range of locking script requirements, because not all unlocking scripts must contain signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction Validation:<br>\n",
    "Every bitcoin validating node will validate transactions by executing the locking and unlocking scripts together. Each input contains an unlocking script and refers to a previously existing UTXO. **The validation software will copy the unlocking script, retrieve the UTXO referenced by the input, and copy the locking script from that UTXO. The unlocking and locking script are then executed in sequence (which was modified to separate execution due to a vulnerability, explained later).** The input is valid if the unlocking script satisfies the locking script conditions (see Separate execution of unlocking and locking scripts). All the inputs are validated independently, as part of the overall validation of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the UTXO is permanently recorded in the blockchain, and therefore is invariable and is unaffected by failed attempts to spend it by reference in a new transaction. Only a valid transaction that correctly satisfies the conditions of the output results in the output being considered as \"spent\" and removed from the set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following image is an example of the unlocking and locking scripts for the most common type of bitcoin transaction (a payment to a public key hash), showing the combined script resulting from the concatenation of the unlocking and locking scripts prior to script validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Combiningscripts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The script execution stack\n",
    "**Bitcoin’s scripting language is called a stack-based language because it uses a data structure called a stack**. A stack is a very simple data structure that can be visualized as a stack of cards. A stack allows two operations: push and pop. Push adds an item on top of the stack. Pop removes the top item from the stack. Operations on a stack can only act on the topmost item on the stack. A stack data structure is also called a Last-In-First-Out, or \"LIFO\" queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The scripting language executes the script by processing each item from left to right. Numbers (data constants) are pushed onto the stack. Operators push or pop one or more parameters from the stack, act on them, and might push a result onto the stack.** For example, OP_ADD will pop two items from the stack, add them, and push the resulting sum onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional operators evaluate a condition, producing a boolean result of TRUE or FALSE**. For example, OP_EQUAL pops two items from the stack and pushes TRUE (TRUE is represented by the number 1) if they are equal or FALSE (represented by zero) if they are not equal. **Bitcoin transaction scripts usually contain a conditional operator, so that they can produce the TRUE result that signifies a valid transaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice: Bitcoin's script uses stack with post-order processing/traversal mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A simple script\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s apply what we’ve learned about scripts and stacks to some simple examples for understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bitcoin’s script validation doing simple math, the script `2 3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL` demonstrates the arithmetic addition operator `OP_ADD`, adding two numbers and putting the result on the stack, followed by the conditional operator `OP_EQUAL`, which checks that the resulting sum is equal to 5. For brevity, the OP_ prefix is omitted in the step-by-step example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although most locking scripts refer to a public key hash (essentially, a bitcoin address), thereby requiring proof of ownership to spend the funds, the script does not have to be that complex.** Any combination of locking and unlocking scripts that results in a TRUE value is valid. The simple arithmetic we used as an example of the scripting language is also a valid locking script that can be used to lock a transaction output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use part of the arithmetic example script as the locking script:<br>\n",
    "`3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL`\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be satisfied by a transaction containing an input with the unlocking script:<br>\n",
    "`2`\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation software combines the locking and unlocking scripts and the resulting script is:<br>\n",
    "`2 3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL`\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the step-by-step example in Bitcoin’s script validation doing simple math, when this script is executed, the result is OP_TRUE, making the transaction valid. **Not only is this a valid transaction output locking script, but the resulting UTXO could be spent by anyone with the arithmetic skills to know that the number 2 satisfies the script.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ScriptValidation-SimpleMath.png)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Transactions are valid if the top result on the stack is TRUE (noted as &#x7b;0x01&#x7d;), any other nonzero value, or if the stack is empty after script execution. Transactions are invalid if the top value on the stack is FALSE (a zero-length empty value, noted as &#x7b;&#x7d;) or if script execution is halted explicitly by an operator, such as OP_VERIFY, OP_RETURN, or a conditional terminator such as OP_ENDIF. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a slightly more complex script, which calculates `2 + 7 - 3 + 1`. Notice that when the script contains several operators in a row, the stack allows the results of one operator to be acted upon by the next operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "`2 7 OP_ADD 3 OP_SUB 1 OP_ADD 7 OP_EQUAL`<br>\n",
    "Try validating the preceding script yourself using pencil and paper. When the script execution ends, you should be left with the value TRUE on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Separate execution of unlocking and locking scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the original bitcoin client, the unlocking and locking scripts were concatenated and executed in sequence (both script are put together in sequence and with the help of a single stack, as shown in simple script example above, validation was performed).** For security reasons, this was changed in 2010, because of a vulnerability that allowed a malformed unlocking script to push data onto the stack and corrupt the locking script. **In the current implementation, the scripts are executed separately with the stack transferred between the two executions**, as described:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, the unlocking script is executed, using the stack execution engine. If the unlocking script is executed without errors (e.g., it has no \"dangling\" operators left over), the main stack is copied and the locking script is executed. <br><br>\n",
    "- If the result of executing the locking script with the stack data copied from the unlocking script is \"TRUE,\" the unlocking script has succeeded in resolving the conditions imposed by the locking script and, therefore, the input is a valid authorization to spend the UTXO. <br><br>\n",
    "- If any result other than \"TRUE\" remains after execution of the combined script, the input is invalid because it has failed to satisfy the spending conditions placed on the UTXO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH)\n",
    "Note: Public key hash is nothing but the address without the Base58Check encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of transactions processed on the bitcoin network spend outputs locked with a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash or \"P2PKH\" script. **These outputs contain a locking script that locks the output to a public key hash, more commonly known as a bitcoin address. An output locked by a P2PKH script can be unlocked (spent) by presenting a public key and a digital signature created by the corresponding private key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s look at Alice’s payment to Bob’s Cafe again. Alice made a payment of 0.015 bitcoin to the cafe’s bitcoin address. That transaction output would have a locking script of the form:<br>\n",
    "`OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <Cafe Public Key Hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cafe Public Key Hash is equivalent to the bitcoin address of the cafe, without the Base58Check encoding. Most applications would show the public key hash in hexadecimal encoding and not the familiar bitcoin address Base58Check format that begins with a \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding locking script can be satisfied with an unlocking script of the form:<br>\n",
    "`<Cafe Signature> <Cafe Public Key>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The two scripts together would form the following combined validation script (unlocking script + locking script):<br>\n",
    "`<Cafe Signature> <Cafe Public Key> OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <Cafe Public Key Hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`\n",
    "\n",
    "**When executed, this combined script will evaluate to TRUE if, and only if, the unlocking script matches the conditions set by the locking script**. In other words, the result will be TRUE if the unlocking script has a valid signature from the cafe’s private key that corresponds to the public key hash set as an encumbrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following figure depicts a step-by-step execution of the combined script, which will prove this is a valid transaction:\n",
